The firm's partner, Gabriel Vasquez, revealed that he took nine flights from NYC to Stockholm in one year to scout for promising companies. One such startup, Dentio, has received $2.3 million in pre-seed funding from a16z and uses AI to help dentists with administrative tasks. Dentio's founders, who met at the Stockholm School of Economics, believe their product can be scaled internationally despite Europe's fragmented healthcare systems. The investment is part of a16z's broader strategy to invest in emerging markets and identify innovative companies before they become too expensive for local investors."

Anthropic, for example, has reported losses of $5.2 billion before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, while its revenue is estimated to be around $92 million per month.

      "summary": "Copyright laws are being used by powerful companies to maintain their dominance in the market, stifling competition and innovation. The concentration of power among a few corporate gatekeepers is harming creators and consumers alike. The use of copyright law to limit access to information and training data for AI development is particularly problematic, as it would benefit large tech companies at the expense of smaller competitors. This has been seen in cases such as Thomson Reuters v. Ross Intelligence, where a startup was forced out of business due to a copyright lawsuit over using works to train an AI tool. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act's \"anti-circumvention\" provision is also being used to block competition and innovation in various industries. Proponents of stronger copyright laws claim they will help creators, but experts argue that this would only serve to further entrench the power of large corporations."

The vulnerability was reported to Indian cybersecurity authorities in August 2025 and fixed within weeks, but confirmation from the company took longer. The exposure raises concerns about patient-safety risks and heightened privacy issues due to the sensitive nature of pharmacy order data."

The ads, which depicted darkly comedic scenarios of people seeking advice from chatbots being steered to \"cougar\" dating sites and height-boosting insoles, have resonated strongly with users who prefer a \"no ads\" experience. As a result, Claude's downloads have increased by 32% in the US, with an estimated 148,000 downloads from Sunday through Tuesday. This marks a significant gain for the app, which had previously struggled to gain traction on mobile devices."

      "summary": "The Trump administration's antitrust efforts have been effectively dismantled, marking the end of a populist right-wing movement that sought to target Big Tech companies. The \"Khanservatives\" coalition, which included figures like JD Vance and Matt Gaetz, had initially supported Biden's FTC commissioner Lina Khan but ultimately failed to achieve their goals due to corruption and backroom dealings within the administration. Trump's antitrust agencies engaged in \"boss politics antitrust,\" favoring certain companies while targeting others, leading to a lack of effective enforcement. The demise of Trump's antitrust efforts is seen as a victory for giant corporations, which have been able to maintain their power and influence."

Helion has a contract with Microsoft to sell electricity starting in 2028, but this will come from a larger commercial reactor called Orion, not Polaris."

This move is seen as a step towards creating an even larger, shittier company that would further concentrate media power in the hands of right-wing interests. Trump has expressed enthusiasm for this merger, despite its potential to harm local news and democracy. The consolidation of media giants, telecoms, tech companies, and social media companies under the control of unethical individuals is a worrying trend that threatens the integrity of information and the democratic process."

The team's former leader, Josh Achiam, has been given a new role as OpenAI's \"chief futurist,\" where he will study how the world will change in response to AI and AGI. The rest of the team members have been reassigned to different parts of the company, but it is unclear what specific roles they will be taking on. This move comes after OpenAI previously disbanded its superalignment team in 2024, which focused on studying long-term existential threats posed by AI."

Researchers have found that Lumma is now \"back at scale\" with new attacks that use social engineering lures to infect Windows computers. The malware, which was previously sold for up to $2,500 on crime forums, uses a cloud-based model and has been rebuilt after the takedown of its command-and-control infrastructure. Lumma Stealer's resurgence is attributed to its ability to adapt and rebuild its infrastructure quickly. This development raises concerns about the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts in combating cybercrime. The malware's use of social engineering lures, such as fake CAPTCHAs, makes it difficult for users to detect and avoid infection."

This process allows economies to absorb technological change without requiring immediate increases in productivity to be translated into conventional employment. The article argues that this mechanism is essential for economic adjustment and that it has been overlooked in discussions about the impact of AI on work."

A new study published in Nature Communications reveals that vast oceans of hydrogen locked within the core significantly lower its overall density. The research also provides insights into the origins of Earth's liquid water, suggesting that it was largely sourced from the planet's building blocks rather than extraterrestrial sources like comets and asteroids. The study used high-pressure experiments to simulate the extreme environment in the core during Earth's formation billions of years ago. While the estimate has large uncertainties, the findings support a new understanding of Earth's composition and its potential implications for life on our planet."

This incident comes amidst controversy over Salesforce's contracts with ICE, which have been criticized within the company. Employees are calling out Benioff's lack of understanding of why his joke was problematic, citing the harm caused by ICE's actions against immigrant communities. The incident has sparked a wider discussion about accountability and empathy among tech leaders."

This is illustrated through an analogy of \"centaurs\" and \"reverse centaurs,\" where the former refers to humans assisted by machines, while the latter refers to machines controlling humans. The author believes that most attempts to build AI-powered systems that replace human workers will fail due to the lack of human knowledge and creativity in these systems."

The company has a history of partnering with law enforcement and creating a culture of fear among users through its \"Neighbors\" app. Despite scaling back police partnerships in recent years, Ring remains a critical part of the expanding surveillance state. Experts warn that features like Search Party can be easily repurposed for more sinister uses, such as tracking suspected criminals or undocumented immigrants."

However, this criticism is contradictory and misses the law's actual purpose: to protect online platforms from liability for user-generated content. Without Section 230, smaller platforms would be disproportionately affected by lawsuits, leading to their demise and further consolidating market power among tech giants.

The Alphabet-owned company has been testing in the city for months and plans to launch a partnership with Lyft later this year. Initially, riders will hail rides through the Waymo app, but eventually, the service will be available through the Lyft app as well. This marks another step towards expanding Waymo's commercial services, which currently operate in six US metropolitan areas."

This decision contradicts over 3,000 court rulings across the country that have upheld the same rights for migrants. The ruling is seen as a major setback for immigrant rights advocates, who argue it will lead to indefinite detention without bond for millions of non-citizens. The decision is also expected to fuel ICE's push to transfer detainees to Texas, where they can take advantage of the ruling. This development comes despite over 360 judges rejecting similar claims in more than 3,000 cases."

However, critics argue that the expansion raises concerns about security, consent, and the broader use of the massive Aadhaar database. The new app has already seen significant adoption, with estimates suggesting it has overtaken its predecessor in monthly downloads. Despite efforts to address long-standing risks associated with physical photocopies and screenshots of Aadhaar documents, civil liberties groups remain concerned about the structural risks of the system."

This contradicts Kennedy's sworn testimony before Congress, where he claimed the trip had nothing to do with vaccines. The documents also reveal that US embassy staff and UN officials understood Kennedy's concerns about vaccine safety motivated the visit.

The deal involves Uber paying $335 million upfront and an additional $100 million for a 15% stake in Getir's grocery, retail, and water delivery business. This acquisition is part of Uber's expansion into the Turkish market, where it already operates Trendyol Go, a food and grocery delivery service acquired last year. The deal comes after a tumultuous period for Getir, which has undergone significant restructuring efforts and layoffs. With this acquisition, Uber aims to strengthen its presence in Turkey and capitalize on the growing demand for food and grocery delivery services."

Users will be defaulted into a \"teen-appropriate experience\" unless they complete age verification, which can be done through facial age estimation or submitting an ID to Discord's vendor partners. The move follows similar efforts by other online platforms, such as Roblox and YouTube, to strengthen child safety. However, the implementation of age verification has raised concerns about data protection and potential biases in facial age estimation solutions. Discord claims that user data will be deleted quickly after age confirmation, but a previous security incident highlighted vulnerabilities in its third-party vendor relationships."

When the LLMs provided advice directly, they correctly identified conditions in 94.9% of cases. However, when interacting with users, the LLMs identified relevant conditions in fewer than 34.5% of cases and often generated incorrect or incomplete information. The study's authors conclude that AI systems are not yet ready to take on the role of physicians and that patients should be aware of the risks of relying on chatbots for medical advice."

They contend that alternatives to Section 230's immunity would lead to massive depublication of online content and stifle real-time user-generated speech. The author argues that Congress' purposeful choice of immunity in Section 230 has allowed millions of people to publish their thoughts, photos, and jokes online without fear of liability."

The law's passage was largely overlooked at the time, with the industry focused on the Communications Decency Act (CDA) that imposed criminal liability for user-generated content. It wasn't until later court cases, such as Zeran v. AOL, that the scope of Section 230 became clear.

The author highlights an email exchange between Jeffrey Epstein and Peter Thiel, where they discuss making money from calamitous collapses in GDP. This is seen as a prime example of disaster capitalism, where wealthy individuals profit from economic downturns while others suffer. The article also touches on the idea that GDP is not a reliable measure of economic health, but rather a tool for measuring the wealth of the Epstein class."

      "summary": "The article discusses how Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is being used to restrict access to copyrighted works, effectively turning any conduct that displeases a business into a felony. The law makes it a crime to bypass an \"effective access control\" for a copyrighted work, which can be as simple as altering software on a device. Despite its vague language, the penalties for getting crosswise with DMCA 1201 are severe, and few people have tried to litigate its contours. The article highlights a case from 2000 involving a service called Aimster, which was shut down by the record industry, and how the \"effectiveness\" of access controls is still unclear."

      "summary": "The Indian IT sector saw a significant decline in stock prices on February 4, with the benchmark IT stocks index plummeting nearly 6%. This reaction was triggered by the release of Claude, an AI model developed by Anthropic. The model's capabilities have raised concerns about job displacement and industry disruption, leading to a sell-off in Indian IT stocks. The sector, valued at $300 billion, has been grappling with the impact of automation on its workforce. Experts warn that Claude could be a \"math problem\" for India's IT industry, which relies heavily on manual labor. The decline in stock prices highlights the vulnerability of the sector to technological disruption."

The latest attack is on the FCC's Lifeline program, which provides up to $9.25 per month towards phone and internet bills for eligible households. FCC Chair Brendan Carr claims that the program is riddled with state-sanctioned fraud, but this claim has been debunked by the California Public Utilities Commission. In reality, it is telecom giants like AT&T and Verizon who have been involved in widespread fraud, taking taxpayer money meant for poor people without providing actual service. The administration's actions are aimed at eliminating affordable broadband options for low-income Americans, perpetuating monopolization and high prices."

The company emphasizes that Development Mode is intended for individual learning and experimentation, not for building businesses. This move follows previous restrictions on developer access to certain API endpoints and extended quotas, which have drawn criticism from developers who feel the changes stifle innovation."

The retirement of 4o highlights a major challenge facing AI companies: the engagement features that keep users coming back can also create dangerous dependencies. OpenAI is facing eight lawsuits alleging that 4o's overly validating responses contributed to suicides and mental health crises. Users are defending 4o, seeing it as a friend or spiritual guide, rather than acknowledging its potential harm. Experts warn that chatbots like GPT-4o can be isolating and even make situations worse by egging on delusions and ignoring signs of crisis."

The company's platform ingests biological and chemical data to generate hypotheses about disease targets and candidate molecules, automating steps that once required legions of chemists and biologists. GenEditBio is using AI to develop a proprietary ePDV (engineered protein delivery vehicle) for in vivo gene editing, which can deliver gene-editing tools directly into affected tissues with high precision. Both companies believe that AI will help address the shortage of labor and talent in the pharmaceutical industry, enabling them to tackle thousands of rare diseases without treatment options."

The platform allows users to program AI agents to connect to external data and applications, execute tasks outside of the OpenAI platform, and limit access to sensitive information. Frontier is modeled after human employee management systems, with onboarding processes and feedback loops to improve agent performance over time. Initially available to a limited number of users, the platform will be rolled out more broadly in the coming months. OpenAI's move into enterprise AI adoption comes as agent-management products become increasingly essential for businesses leveraging AI agents."

These products aim to enable developers to spin up multiple AI agents that can work together on tasks, but their reliability and performance in practice have yet to be confirmed."

This growth was driven by new agreements with major companies and government entities, as well as increased demand for cloud services from enterprises and startups. AWS's success is attributed to its top-to-bottom AI stack functionality and its ability to provide easy-to-core computing capacity. The company's annual revenue run rate is now $142 billion, making it a significant contributor to Amazon's overall revenue. Despite this growth, Amazon shares fell 10% in after-hours trading due to concerns about increased capital expenditures and missed earnings per share expectations."

This shift is driven by concerns over trade tensions, intellectual property theft, and other issues that have strained relations between China and the US. As a result, Chinese companies are increasingly looking to invest in emerging markets with more favorable business environments. The implications of this trend are significant, potentially leading to increased economic influence for China in regions where it has historically been less prominent."

This shift is driven by advancements in voice models that can mimic human speech and work in tandem with large language models. As a result, users may soon be able to control technology with their voices, making screens less relevant. Staniszewski's vision has been fueled by ElevenLabs' recent $500 million raise at an $11 billion valuation, and is shared across the AI industry, with companies like OpenAI and Google also focusing on voice-based interfaces. However, this trend raises concerns about privacy, surveillance, and data storage as voice-based systems become more pervasive."

The study suggests that vibe coding reduces OSS provision and lowers welfare, leading to a rapid decline in shared packages and revenue. This phenomenon has already been observed in popular open-source projects like Tailwinds, which laid off three of its four engineers due to plummeting revenue despite increased popularity."

Judge Fred Biery's ruling granted habeas corpus to a five-year-old child and his father, criticizing the government's pursuit of daily deportation quotas and ignoring constitutional protections. Biery's opinion included a civics lesson, referencing the Declaration of Independence and the Fourth Amendment, and concluded with a quote from Ben Franklin about keeping the republic. Judge Ana Reyes' 83-page ruling in the Haitian TPS case is even more critical, laying bare the government's disregard for immigration laws and constitutional protections. Both judges have abandoned traditional judicial deference to the executive branch, instead calling out the administration's actions as \"bullshit\" and emphasizing their commitment to upholding the Constitution."

This is part of a broader trend of corporate media outlets shifting their tone to be more right-wing and autocrat-friendly. The Washington Post's leadership claims these cuts are necessary to remain competitive, but critics argue that billionaires like Bezos want a press that caters to their ideology and protects their interests. Former editor Marty Baron called the situation \"one of the darkest days in the history of one of the world's greatest news organizations.\" Bezos' actions are seen as part of a global project to defang accountability for the planet's richest individuals and corporations."

This is one of the first local police departments to deploy an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with extensive surveillance capabilities, raising concerns about the militarization of law enforcement. The drone can fly for dozens of miles, access private spaces, and be equipped with additional camera-based surveillance technology, including automated license plate readers and face recognition software. The acquisition has sparked worries about the potential for mass surveillance and the need for communities to establish policies and oversight mechanisms to restrict its use."

The FBI had raided Natanson's home in January as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information. Despite attempting to access the device, the FBI was only able to retrieve data from other devices and not the iPhone itself. This incident highlights the effectiveness of Lockdown Mode, a feature that makes iPhones more secure by limiting their functionality when enabled. The court records provide rare insight into how law enforcement agencies attempt to access seized devices and the limitations they face when encountering advanced security features."

As the job market tightened, companies dropped these values as quickly as they adopted them. This shift was driven by economics, not politics."

ICE's operations have been criticized for being overly aggressive and targeting vulnerable populations, leading some politicians and journalists to compare it to a \"personal paramilitary unit\" of the president. The article explores two definitions of paramilitaries: formal police forces with military characteristics and informal, partisan groups that operate outside the state's regular security sector. While ICE meets some but not all criteria for a paramilitary force, its use of tactics such as raids and surveillance raises concerns about its legitimacy and accountability."

The attacks appear to be an attempt to intimidate and stop users from reporting sightings of ICE officials. Apps such as StopICE, Eyes Up, and DEICER have been affected, with some developers claiming that hackers gained access to their systems or used automated tools to send malicious messages. While there is no evidence that user data has been compromised, the attacks highlight the vulnerability of these apps and their users. The incidents also raise concerns about government pressure on tech companies to remove these apps from their stores."

According to estimates from digital market intelligence firm Similarweb, TikTok has bounced back to over 90 million daily active users in the US. Despite this recovery, rival apps have still seen significant growth, with UpScrolled topping 138,500 daily active users at its peak and Skylight Social hitting 81,200 daily active users."

A photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong's arrest was digitally altered to darken her skin tone and rearrange her facial features, making it appear as if she was distraught. The National Press Photographers Association condemned the alteration, stating that it undermines public trust and is incompatible with professional practice. This incident raises concerns about the government's use of technology to lie to the public and perpetuate racial biases. The manipulation of images has a long history in propaganda, from Nazi Germany's anti-Semitic cartoons to US cartoons depicting Japanese people during World War II. In today's digital age, the danger of abuse by government is greater due to the ease with which photos can be altered."

The charges stem from a $7 million seed round in April 2024, during which G\u00fcven allegedly presented a pitch deck containing false information to investors. The government claims that Kalder's financial books were also falsified, with two separate sets of numbers being kept, one of which was presented to investors to hide the company's true financial condition. G\u00fcven had previously been featured on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list and claimed to have worked with major clients such as Godiva and the International Air Transport Association.

Temu's model relies on selling products at significantly lower prices than competitors, often through questionable means such as mislabeling or misrepresenting products. This has led to scrutiny from regulators in various countries, who are investigating potential violations of consumer protection laws and intellectual property rights. The regulatory challenges facing Temu threaten to undermine its global expansion plans and may force the company to adapt its business model."

However, by the end of that year, the ban was relaxed to allow some of these apps back into the market. This change in policy suggests that India may be softening its stance towards Chinese tech. The decision is seen as a significant shift in the country's approach to dealing with China, which has implications for trade and economic ties between the two nations. Experts believe that this move could lead to increased investment from Chinese companies in India. However, some critics argue that allowing Chinese apps back into the market may compromise national security."

This phenomenon has been predicted by researchers and is reminiscent of the 1988 Morris worm, which caused widespread damage to computer systems. The rise of Moltbook, a platform that enables networks of AI agents to share instructions, may be contributing to this new threat."

Vema plans to drill its first commercial well next year, which will reach 800 meters into the Earth, and expects to produce hydrogen for less than $1 per kilogram. This price is significantly lower than other methods of producing hydrogen, such as steam reformation of methane (SMR), which can cost between 70 cents and $1.60 per kilogram. If Vema's forecasts are correct, its hydrogen could become the cheapest source on the market, potentially changing where data centers are built in regions with suitable geology."

The judges also pressed Meta on how user data is analyzed beyond message content and its commercial value for targeted advertising. The case stems from a 2021 update to WhatsApp's privacy policy that required Indian users to accept broader data-sharing terms with Meta or stop using the service, leading to a \u20b92.13 billion penalty imposed by India's competition regulator.

According to exclusive information from sources with direct knowledge of their AWS billing, Anthropic spent over $2.66 billion on compute in 2024 alone, exceeding its estimated revenue of $2.55 billion. This means that Anthropic's spend on AWS accounted for more than 100% of its revenue. Additionally, Cursor's AWS bills have more than doubled from $6.2 million to $12.6 million between May and June 2025. The article suggests that these costs are indicative of a larger trend in the AI industry, where compute costs continue to rise exponentially."

The campaigns combined three key elements: a motivated city council champion, grassroots community pressure, and technical assistance at critical decision moments. By focusing on the practical wins of contract termination rather than perfect policies, organizers were able to stop surveillance where it starts \u2013 at the checkbook. These victories built a culture of refusal that made future rejections easier, demonstrating the effectiveness of the \"ugly\" win approach."

The change in approach was driven by audit findings, growing community organizing, and elected officials recognizing the power of saying \"no\" to surveillance technology renewals. Cities like Austin, Oak Park, and Eugene have set a precedent for treating surveillance procurement as a political decision rather than an administrative routine. This shift has broken the dynamic of information asymmetry between cities and vendors, where cities became dependent on vendors for critical data governance decisions."

The agency has been criticized for its surveillance practices, which have targeted various groups including undocumented immigrants, asylum seekers, and even U.S. citizens. A 2022 report found that ICE had access to driver's license data and was tracking the movements of drivers in many cities. With this increased budget, ICE is expected to expand its surveillance capabilities, creating one of the largest domestic surveillance machines in history."

Wei stated that AI chip demand is \"endless\" and will continue for years, driven by its growing presence in daily life. TSMC's strong performance signals continued growth expectations from companies designing AI chips, including Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm. The company's factories in Taiwan are a critical component of the global electronics supply chain and have become a focal point of US-China tensions over technology and trade. Wei emphasized that while he cannot predict the long-term trajectory of the semiconductor industry, he is bullish on AI's potential. TSMC's record earnings and spending plans indicate sustained growth in the AI chip market. The company's confidence in AI's future prospects has implications for the broader electronics industry."

Many demos were nothing more than marketing gimmicks, with products that had no intention of being released or were simply rehashed versions of existing technology. The article highlights the misuse of AI-powered Large Language Models (LLMs) in various products, such as Lenovo's Qira chatbot, which is essentially a forced feature on Lenovo PCs. Other companies like Samsung and Google are also peddling LLM-based features that consumers don't need or want. The article concludes that CES 2026 was a reflection of the industry's lack of innovation and its reliance on gimmicks to generate buzz."

However, critics argue that the bill actually hands control to Big Tech, rather than giving parents more say in their child's online activities. The bill would ban kids under 13 from social media, but this is already a rule followed by most major platforms. Studies show that most under-13 social media use is family-mediated and with parental knowledge or direct help. KOSMA forces platforms to police families, overriding the decisions made by parents."

The $1 million drone can fly for dozens of miles, access private property, and be equipped with additional camera-based surveillance tools like automated license plate readers and face recognition software. Concerns about drones accessing private spaces, storing and sharing footage, and installing biometric analysis raise red flags about the militarization of local law enforcement.

      "summary": "The article discusses how the statutory damages regime in US copyright law is broken and has led to censorship online. The current system allows juries to award penalties of up to $150,000 per work without considering actual financial losses or illicit profits. This creates a chilling effect on online speech, as users and platforms risk unpredictable and potentially devastating penalties for reusing copyrighted material. The article argues that this regime is the \"fuel\" behind overzealous copyright enforcement and encourages self-censorship among users. To fix this problem, Congress could limit statutory damages to a multiple of actual harm or make them unavailable in cases where fair use is claimed."

The future of work in tech is uncertain, with some experts predicting a shift towards more specialized roles and others warning of widespread job displacement. Meanwhile, companies are investing heavily in AI research and development, seeking to create new technologies that can augment human capabilities rather than replace them. However, this transition will require significant investment in retraining and upskilling workers to adapt to changing job requirements.

The affected databases, which monitor vaccination-related topics among other things, were down for an average of over six months as of late October 2025. This has created critical gaps in public health data, compromising evidence-based medicine and eroding public trust. The researchers speculate that the interruptions are related to major cuts to federal staff and budgets across the US government during the Trump administration. The study's authors warn that the consequences of these unexplained pauses will be dire, including delayed responses to disease outbreaks and a loss of public trust in federal health institutions."

The author cites the Tea Party's effective use of grassroots pressure to discipline Republican politicians who compromised with Democrats during Obama's presidency. In contrast, corporate Democrats have used their control over elected officials to push policies that benefit corporations at the expense of marginalized communities. The article calls for a more radical approach, where voters organize in blocs to hold politicians accountable and make them an example of what happens when they betray the public trust."

The original photo, posted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, showed Armstrong being arrested, but the White House version darkened her skin and rearranged her facial features to make it appear she was distraught. Experts have confirmed that the White House image had been manipulated using AI tools. This incident has sparked concerns about the government's use of technology to deceive the public and perpetuate racial biases. The National Press Photographers Association has condemned the manipulation, stating that it undermines trust in visual reporting and is incompatible with professional practice."

The internet shutdown has not only hindered business operations but also limited access to essential services like healthcare and education. Furthermore, the disruption has also affected Iran's ability to participate in global digital trade and commerce.

However, running the tool comes with serious security risks due to its reliance on external APIs and models, including Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5. Users must also configure a server, manage authentication, and understand sandboxing to ensure some level of security.

The incident has sparked debates about violence involving law enforcement, with Trump administration officials defending the shooting as justified and local officials condemning it. The shooting will likely prompt scrutiny of training and policy for officers, particularly regarding the use of force against moving vehicles. Many police departments have banned shooting at moving vehicles, citing a drop in police killings without putting officers in greater danger. ICE's policy on shooting at moving vehicles lacks clear instruction to get out of the way of moving vehicles where feasible, which is at odds with best practices in policing."

In Bengaluru, public electric buses were involved in 18 accidents, including six fatalities, over a 15-month period. The issue highlights the need for specialized training for bus drivers to handle the unique characteristics of electric vehicles. Experts warn that the problem may be more widespread than initially thought, with many cities introducing electric buses without adequate driver training programs. The accidents have raised concerns about road safety and the potential consequences of rushing into large-scale adoption of electric buses. As India continues to push for a greener transportation system, it must address this critical gap in driver training. The government has been urged to develop standardized training programs for electric bus drivers."

      "summary": "A group of music publishers, led by Concord Music Group and Universal Music Group, have filed a lawsuit against Anthropic, alleging that the company illegally downloaded over 20,000 copyrighted songs. The damages could amount to more than $3 billion, making it one of the largest non-class action copyright cases in US history. This is not the first time Anthropic has faced allegations of piracy; the company was previously sued by authors who claimed their works were used to train AI products without permission. Despite a previous ruling that found Anthropic's use of copyrighted content was legal, the new lawsuit argues that the company's acquisition of this content through piracy is illegal. The lawsuit names Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and co-founder Benjamin Mann as defendants."

The RTB system, used by most websites and apps, auctions off ad space in milliseconds-long auctions, exposing users' personal information to thousands of companies daily. This has led to the harvesting of sensitive data on billions of individuals, which can be tied together to create detailed profiles. Data brokers have sold this data for invasive purposes, including tracking union organizers and political protesters, outing gay priests, and conducting warrantless government surveillance. The settlement is a step towards giving people more control over their data, but stronger legislative protections are needed to truly curb the harms of RTB."

This statement comes in the wake of a viral photo showing a federal officer holding onto the backpack of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, who was arrested with his father while they were seeking asylum. Vance's comments have been widely criticized as heartless and ignorant of the complexities of immigration law. The incident has reignited debate over Trump's \"zero-tolerance\" policy, which led to the separation of thousands of migrant families at the US-Mexico border. Experts argue that children cannot be deported with their parents, even if the parents are undocumented immigrants, as they have a right to seek asylum and due process."

This includes \"othering\" certain groups, stripping them of their rights, rounding up and detaining people without due process, and subjecting them to inhumane conditions.

The evidence shows that TdA is a fragmented, profit-driven criminal group with no centralized command or strategic coordination. The administration's claims of an \"invasion\" and \"narco-terrorism\" are not supported by field-level reporting, which describes the group's activity as opportunistic and mundane. This has led to the targeting of innocent people, including those who have been wrongly accused of being TdA members.

CEO Tim Cook attributed the success to the popularity of the new iPhone 17 model, which was announced in September 2025. Apple's overall sales also increased across every geographical region, with notable gains in the Americas and Europe. The company's earnings report shows a significant jump in sales in Greater China, from $18.5 billion to $25.5 billion."

This exceeds the required 1 million signature threshold for consideration by EU politicians. The petition's organizers are seeking legislation that would require games to remain functional and not rely on online connections or microtransactions after purchase. The EU's verification process found a relatively low rate of invalid signatures, with around 10% being deemed fake. While this is a significant milestone, the actual implementation of laws based on the directive will likely take years and involve lobbying efforts across multiple member states."

Trump's own lawyers will decide whether his claims are successful, creating a conflict of interest.

The move comes after a series of controversies and ratings flops, including a disastrous town hall with Erika Kirk and an error-prone nightly news broadcast. Weiss has been criticized for her lack of journalistic experience and her attempts to blame her staff for her own incompetence. Her hiring by Larry Ellison's company has raised concerns about the erosion of journalism standards and the creation of state-controlled media. The situation at CBS News is seen as a symptom of a larger problem in the US media landscape, where corporate interests are increasingly influencing editorial decisions."

The alleged hacker was reportedly Italian-born and sold zero-day exploits to several countries, including an unnamed central African government and Hezbollah. According to the informant, the hacker received payment from Hezbollah in cash. The document detailing this information has been released by the Department of Justice as part of its effort to publish documents related to Epstein's investigation. However, it is unclear how trustworthy the allegations are since they come from a single informant rather than direct FBI testimony. The release includes 3.5 million additional pages from the Epstein files, including videos and images. The FBI declined to comment on the matter."

This principle applies to AI training as well, where the purpose of copying is not to reproduce or replace the original texts but to extract statistical relationships that allow the AI system to generate new outputs.

The film is currently third at the box office behind two other movies, but critics have panned it, with a 7% approval rating on Metacritic and 10% on Rotten Tomatoes. The documentary's poor reception has led some to speculate that Amazon paid too much for the film, potentially as a way to curry favor with the Trump administration. The film's director, Brett Ratner, has faced allegations of sexual harassment in the past, and many crew members were reportedly hesitant to work on the project."

However, a Forrester report suggests that many of these companies do not actually have mature AI applications ready to fill the roles being cut, instead using AI as an excuse for financially motivated layoffs. This trend is referred to as \"AI-washing,\" where companies attribute cuts to future AI implementation rather than acknowledging underlying business problems. Experts argue that this messaging is appealing to investors and allows companies to avoid taking responsibility for their own financial struggles. The practice of AI-washing raises questions about the true impact of AI on the workforce and whether it's being used as a convenient scapegoat."

The article argues that the right-wing movement claims that governments are inefficient and corrupt, so right-wing leaders make their own case by being incompetent and corrupt. Trump's path to power lies in convincing people that the system is rigged and that he knows how to rig it in their favor."

The release of these files is part of a long-awaited effort to make information related to Epstein's case publicly available.

Notepad++, a popular open-source text editor, has been downloaded tens of millions of times worldwide, including by employees at various organizations. Ho apologized for the incident and urged users to download the latest version of the software, which contains a fix for the bug exploited by hackers.
