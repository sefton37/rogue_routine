This domain examines whether technology systems cultivate trust or exploit fear. Sieve scores articles here when they involve:

- **Manufactured scarcity** — Artificial limitations designed to create urgency or drive purchasing behavior
- **Crisis profiteering** — Leveraging emergencies, outages, or social anxiety for commercial or political gain
- **Psychological safety** — Whether platforms and technologies create environments where people feel safe to participate honestly
- **Trust-based systems** — Technology designed around transparency, reliability, and earned confidence

Articles scoring high on Fear vs. Trust often cover cybersecurity fearmongering vs. legitimate threat reporting, manipulative pricing during outages, misinformation campaigns, platform trust and safety teams, and technologies designed to build rather than erode social trust.

Every article Sieve processes receives a score of 0–3 on this domain. Browse articles scored on this domain in the [Reader](/reader/?axioms=fear_trust).
