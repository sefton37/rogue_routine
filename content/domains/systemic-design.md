Systemic design examines how the structure of policies, incentives, and feedback loops shapes technology outcomes — often in ways that weren't intended. Sieve scores articles on this domain when they involve:

- **Policy design** — Legislation, regulation, and governance frameworks that shape how technology develops and is deployed
- **Feedback loops** — Self-reinforcing cycles where system outputs become inputs, amplifying effects over time
- **Unintended consequences** — Outcomes that emerge from well-intentioned designs interacting with complex systems
- **Incentive architecture** — How reward structures, metrics, and business models drive behavior across technology ecosystems

Articles scoring high on Systemic Design often cover AI regulation proposals, content moderation policy effects, platform incentive structures that produce harmful outcomes, and cases where technology policy produces consequences opposite to its stated goals.

Every article Sieve processes receives a score of 0–3 on this domain. Browse articles scored on this domain in the [Reader](/reader/?axioms=systemic_design).
