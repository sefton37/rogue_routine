Democratization tracks whether technology expands access to tools, knowledge, and capability — or restricts it. Sieve scores articles on this domain when they involve:

- **Open-source** — Software, models, and datasets released for public use, modification, and redistribution
- **Local-first computing** — Technology that works without cloud dependencies, keeping data and processing on user-controlled hardware
- **Digital divide** — Gaps in technology access across economic, geographic, and demographic lines
- **Right to repair** — The ability to fix, modify, and maintain the technology you own
- **Tool access** — Whether powerful capabilities are available broadly or restricted to those who can pay

Articles scoring high on Democratization often cover open-source AI model releases, local-first software projects, broadband access initiatives, right-to-repair legislation, and the tension between proprietary platforms and open alternatives.

Every article Sieve processes receives a score of 0–3 on this domain. Browse articles scored on this domain in the [Reader](/reader/?axioms=democratization).
