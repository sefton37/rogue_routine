This domain tracks the spectrum between systems that compel participation and those built on voluntary collaboration. Sieve scores articles here when they involve:

- **Cooperative models** — Technology built around shared ownership, governance, or benefit
- **Mutual aid platforms** — Systems designed to facilitate voluntary resource sharing and community support
- **Consent frameworks** — Whether users meaningfully choose to participate or are coerced through dark patterns, lock-in, or lack of alternatives
- **Voluntary participation** — The degree to which engagement with a technology or platform is genuinely optional

Articles scoring high on Coercion vs. Cooperation often cover platform lock-in strategies, worker organizing in tech, cooperative alternatives to corporate platforms, terms-of-service changes that remove user choice, and the tension between network effects and genuine opt-in.

Every article Sieve processes receives a score of 0–3 on this domain. Browse articles scored on this domain in the [Reader](/reader/?axioms=coercion_cooperation).
