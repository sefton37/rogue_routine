Data sovereignty concerns who controls personal data — its collection, storage, processing, and use. Sieve scores articles on this domain when they involve:

- **Surveillance** — Government and corporate monitoring of digital activity, communications, and movement
- **Biometric collection** — Facial recognition, fingerprint databases, voice profiling, and other biometric systems
- **Consent frameworks** — How permission is obtained (or bypassed) for data collection and use
- **Data portability** — The ability to move personal data between platforms and services
- **Digital rights** — Legal and technical protections for individual data ownership

Articles scoring high on Data Sovereignty often cover privacy legislation (GDPR, state privacy laws), data breaches, government surveillance programs, and emerging frameworks for digital identity and consent.
