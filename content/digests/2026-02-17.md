### ['Students Are Being Treated Like Guinea Pigs:' Inside an AI-Powered Private School](https://www.404media.co/students-are-being-treated-like-guinea-pigs-inside-an-ai-powered-private-school/)
*404 Media*

This article reveals a disturbing trend where students are being exploited by private schools that use AI to capture and monetize their attention. According to 404 Media, Alpha School is using generative AI to create faulty lesson plans that not only fail to meet SAT standards but also make students feel betrayed and anxious due to constant monitoring.

The article highlights the power dynamics at play, where a for-profit company prioritizes profit over student well-being. The school's business model relies on collecting sensitive student data without permission, which is then stored in an easily accessible Google Drive folder. This raises serious concerns about data sovereignty and the exploitation of students' personal information.

The story also emphasizes the lack of transparency and accountability within Alpha School. Former employees have come forward to expose the flaws in the school's AI-powered education system, but their voices are being drowned out by fawning media coverage from outlets like Fox News and The New York Times.

This article matters because it reveals a systemic problem where technology is being used to control and exploit vulnerable populations, including students. It highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in the use of AI in education, as well as stronger regulations to protect student data and prevent the exploitation of personal information.

> "These questions not only fail to meet SAT standards but also fall short of the quality we promise to deliver," one employee wrote in the company's Workflowy. "From a student's perspective, when answer options don't logically fit the question, it feels like a betrayal of their effort to learn and succeed."
— [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/students-are-being-treated-like-guinea-pigs-inside-an-ai-powered-private-school/)


This quote captures the essence of the problem: students are being treated as guinea pigs in an experiment that prioritizes profit over education. It's a stark reminder of the need for greater oversight and regulation in the use of AI in education.

### [Trump FTC Threatens Apple With A Fake Investigation Into Its Nonexistent ‘Liberal News Bias’](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/17/trump-ftc-threatens-apple-with-a-fake-investigation-into-its-nonexistent-liberal-news-bias/)
*Tech Dirt*

This article reveals a disturbing power dynamic where the Trump FTC is using its authority to intimidate and manipulate companies like Apple into promoting right-wing ideology. According to Tech Dirt, the FTC has threatened Apple with a fake investigation, claiming that the company's news feed is biased against right-wing outlets. However, experts argue that this claim is based on flawed research and that Apple News does not have a liberal bias.

The article highlights how the Trump FTC is using its power to suppress free expression and stifle dissenting voices. By accusing Apple of promoting "liberal" media outlets, the FTC is attempting to silence critical perspectives and create a echo chamber for right-wing views. This move also raises concerns about the erosion of the First Amendment and the chilling effect it has on companies willing to challenge the administration's ideology.

Tech Dirt reports that the FTC's investigation is based on a study by the Media Research Center, which was cited in an article by Rupert Murdoch's New York Post. However, this study is laughable, with experts pointing out its methodological flaws and arbitrary conclusions. The article also notes that the Washington Post, which has been accused of having a "liberal bias," has actually become more right-wing under its owner Jeff Bezos.

The Trump FTC's actions are a clear example of how power can be used to manipulate information and control public discourse. By threatening companies with fake investigations, the administration is attempting to create a culture of fear and self-censorship, where companies are reluctant to challenge its ideology or promote dissenting views. This has serious implications for free expression, the First Amendment, and the integrity of our democratic institutions.

The article also highlights how corporate media bias can be used as a tool for partisan politics. By accusing Apple News of promoting "liberal" outlets, the Trump FTC is attempting to create a narrative that corporate media is biased against right-wing views. However, this ignores the fact that many mainstream outlets have become more corporatist and right-wing under the influence of wealthy owners like Jeff Bezos.

Overall, this article reveals a disturbing trend where power is being used to manipulate information and control public discourse. It highlights the need for greater transparency, accountability, and scrutiny of government agencies and corporate media outlets.

### [New Report Helps Journalists Dig Deeper Into Police Surveillance Technology](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/new-report-helps-journalists-dig-deeper-police-surveillance-technology)
*EFF*

This article reveals a concerning trend of police technology companies making unsubstantiated claims about their products' effectiveness, which can mislead lawmakers and journalists alike. According to EFF, a new report aims to cut through this sales hype by providing tools for journalists to critically evaluate these technologies.

The report highlights the need for transparency and accountability in policing, particularly when it comes to surveillance technology that can have far-reaching consequences for individuals and communities. By shedding light on the often-invasive nature of these tools, EFF reports help to empower journalists to ask better questions about their costs, benefits, and impact on society.

As EFF notes, police technology is often sold as a silver bullet, but this report suggests that such claims may be exaggerated or even false. This is noteworthy because it reveals how the pursuit of profit can lead companies to prioritize sales over accuracy and accountability.

### [Pluralistic: What's a "gig work minimum wage" (17 Feb 2026)](https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/17/no-piecework/)
*Interconnects*

**Daily Briefing**

The article "Pluralistic: What's a 'gig work minimum wage' (17 Feb 2026)" by Interconnects reveals the exploitation of gig economy workers, who are often misclassified as independent contractors to avoid liability and benefits. According to the author, the traditional notion of a minimum wage does not apply to gig workers, who may be paid nothing when they are waiting for a job or have their wages stolen by platforms.

This article matters because it highlights the coercive nature of gig work and the need for alternative solutions, such as a jobs guarantee. The author critiques the business model of gig platforms, which relies on manipulating human attention for profit. As Interconnects reports, the important rate is not what you're paid when you're working, but rather what you're paid when you're waiting for a job.

> "The important rate is what you're paid when you're waiting for a job."
— [Interconnects](https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/17/no-piecework/)


This article shines a light on the gig economy's manipulation of human attention and its consequences for workers' rights. It's a crucial reminder that our economic systems can be designed to prioritize profit over people, but also that there are alternatives, such as cooperative models or jobs guarantees, that can put people first.

### [Cohere launches a family of open multilingual models](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/cohere-launches-a-family-of-open-multilingual-models/)

*Tech Dirt*

This article from Tech Dirt reveals how Australia's social media ban is having a devastating impact on kids with disabilities, who are being isolated from their online communities and friends. The ban was intended to protect young people, but it's clear that it's had the opposite effect, particularly for those who rely on social media as a lifeline.

The article highlights real-world stories of kids like Indy, a 14-year-old autistic girl who used social media to connect with others and cope with her disability. Since the ban took effect, she feels lonely and disconnected. This is not just an anecdotal example; it's a symptom of a larger issue where systemic design has failed to consider the needs of vulnerable populations.

Tech Dirt reports that advocacy groups have warned about this outcome, but their concerns were ignored by policymakers who pushed for the ban. The article also notes that two massive studies involving 125,000 kids found that the "social media is inherently harmful" narrative doesn't hold up. This suggests that the ban was based on flawed assumptions and a lack of understanding about how social media can be a positive force in people's lives.

*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is actively seeking European startups to invest in, with a focus on identifying potential unicorns before they gain international attention. This reveals a power dynamic where large venture capital firms like a16z are exerting influence over emerging markets and startup ecosystems.

The article highlights how a16z's partner Gabriel Vasquez took nine flights from NYC to Stockholm in one year to scout for promising companies, demonstrating the firm's willingness to invest time and resources into identifying potential investments.
