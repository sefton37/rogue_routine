### [Pluralistic: Doctors' union may yet save the NHS from Palantir (12 Feb 2026)](https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/12/palantir-is-ice/)
*Interconnects*

According to Interconnects, this article reveals a disturbing power dynamic at play in the UK's National Health Service (NHS). The Labour government has chosen to hand over patient records to Palantir, a US military contractor with ties to the Trump regime, despite the existence of an open alternative called OpenSAFELY. This decision raises serious concerns about data sovereignty and the potential risks of using Palantir's services.

The article highlights the potential consequences of this choice, including the risk of patient records being used for purposes other than healthcare. It also emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability in government decision-making. As Interconnects reports, "If you weren't paying close attention, you might think that the most grotesque and indefensible aspect of Keir Starmer's Labour government...".

This story matters because it shows how powerful corporations can influence government decisions and compromise public services like healthcare. It also reveals the tension between open-source solutions and proprietary ones, with the latter often prioritizing profit over people's rights. The article emphasizes the importance of democratic oversight and the need for governments to prioritize transparency and accountability in their decision-making processes.

The fact that OpenSAFELY, a proven and advanced open alternative, was passed up in favor of Palantir's solution is particularly concerning. It suggests that the Labour government may be prioritizing short-term gains or convenience over long-term benefits and public trust. As Interconnects notes, this decision has sparked outrage among healthcare professionals and raises questions about the future of the NHS.

Overall, this article highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in government decision-making, particularly when it comes to sensitive issues like patient data. It also underscores the importance of open-source solutions and democratic oversight in ensuring that public services are designed with people's rights and needs in mind.

### [More US investors sue South Korean government over handling of Coupang data breach](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/more-u-s-investors-sue-south-korean-government-over-handling-of-coupang-data-breach/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, a growing number of US investors in Coupang, a South Korean e-commerce company, are suing the South Korean government over its handling of a massive data breach that exposed nearly 34 million customers' personal information. This story matters because it reveals a power struggle between foreign investors and a national government, with significant implications for data sovereignty and corporate accountability.

The dispute centers on the government's actions against Coupang, which has faced extraordinary pressure, including threatened fines, suspension of operations, and travel bans for executives. The investors claim that the government acted unfairly and discriminated against the company, while the government maintains that it is simply enforcing regulations to protect citizens' data.

What's being emphasized here is the tension between national interests and foreign investment, with the South Korean government prioritizing data security over the interests of US investors. Meanwhile, the story downplays the role of Coupang itself in the breach, focusing instead on the government's response.

This case highlights broader patterns of power consolidation, where governments exert control over corporations to protect domestic interests. It also raises questions about the rights of foreign investors and the limits of corporate accountability in the face of national regulations. The fact that US investors are seeking international arbitration under the US-Korea FTA adds another layer of complexity to this dispute.

This development suggests that the stakes are high, and the outcome could have significant implications for future trade agreements and corporate governance.

### [The System Of Checks And Balances Doesn’t Work When One Branch Refuses To Play By The Rules](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/11/the-system-of-checks-and-balances-doesnt-work-when-one-branch-refuses-to-play-by-the-rules/)
*Tech Dirt*

This article, published by Tech Dirt, reveals a disturbing breakdown of the system of checks and balances in the US government. According to Tech Dirt, one branch (the executive) is refusing to play by the rules, while the judicial branch has become complicit in allowing this overreach. The legislative branch, compromised by MAGA bootlickers, is failing to hold the executive accountable.

The article highlights a specific instance where an individual was detained and mistreated by ICE despite a court-ordered release. This case illustrates how the executive branch can ignore court orders with impunity. Tech Dirt reports that this is not an isolated incident, but rather a symptom of a larger problem: the erosion of checks and balances in government.

The article emphasizes that the system of three co-equal branches was designed to prevent any one branch from seizing too much power. However, when one branch refuses to play by the rules, the entire system breaks down. This has led to instances where executive officials have told courts to "go fuck themselves" when they hand down rulings the administration doesn't like.

This story matters because it reveals a fundamental problem with the US government's design. When one branch becomes too powerful and ignores the rule of law, individual rights are compromised. The article highlights the consequences of this power imbalance, where individuals are subjected to arbitrary detention and mistreatment by executive agencies.

The article also underscores the complicity of the judicial branch in allowing this overreach. Tech Dirt notes that a sitting appellate judge made a name for himself in the Trump administration by demonstrating his contempt for the judicial system he's now an integral part of.

Overall, [The System Of Checks And Balances Doesn’t Work When One Branch Refuses To Play By The Rules](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/11/the-system-of-checks-and-balances-doesnt-work-when-one-branch-refuses-to-play-by-the-rules/) is a critical examination of the US government's power dynamics. It reveals how the system can be manipulated and exploited to consolidate power and undermine individual rights.

### [OpenAI researcher quits over ChatGPT ads, warns of "Facebook" path](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/openai-researcher-quits-over-fears-that-chatgpt-ads-could-manipulate-users/)
*Ars Technica*

According to Ars Technica, a former OpenAI researcher has resigned from the company due to concerns over its advertising strategy for ChatGPT. Zoë Hitzig argues that the ads risk exploiting users' personal data, which they shared with the chatbot under the assumption of confidentiality.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals the tension between economic incentives and user privacy in the development of AI-powered technologies. As Hitzig warns, OpenAI's pursuit of profit may lead to a "Facebook" path, where user data is exploited for advertising purposes without users' consent or control. Her resignation adds to the growing debate over advertising in AI chatbots and highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in the tech industry.

Hitzig's concerns are particularly relevant given the sensitive nature of the data users share with ChatGPT, including personal fears, relationship problems, and religious beliefs. Her warning serves as a reminder that the development of AI-powered technologies must prioritize user rights and dignity over economic interests.

*EFF*

According to EFF, the Department of Homeland Security is using administrative subpoenas to demand that tech companies hand over users' personal information, including names and locations. This move has raised concerns about government overreach and erosion of online privacy.

The article reveals a worrying trend where the government is abusing its power to collect data on citizens without proper oversight or accountability. EFF reports that this practice undermines the trust between tech companies and their users, as well as the fundamental right to online anonymity.

> "Criticize the government online? The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) might ask Google to cough up your name."
— [EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/homeland-security-wants-names-effector-383)


This story is noteworthy because it highlights the tension between government surveillance and individual rights in the digital age. It also underscores the importance of tech companies standing up for their users' privacy and advocating for stronger protections against unlawful surveillance.

EFF's advocacy efforts, as reported in this article, demonstrate a crucial aspect of defending online freedom: holding power accountable through collective action.

### [Peter Mandelson Invokes Press Harassment Protections To Dodge Questions About His Support Of Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/11/peter-mandelson-invokes-press-harassment-protections-to-dodge-questions-about-his-support-of-jeffrey-epstein/)
*Tech Dirt*

According to Tech Dirt, Peter Mandelson has used press harassment protections to avoid answering questions about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This move is noteworthy because it reveals how powerful individuals can manipulate regulatory machinery to shield themselves from public scrutiny.

Mandelson's representatives have sent a confidential notice to UK media outlets, asking them not to contact or photograph him and directing requests for comment to a third party. This action demonstrates a power consolidation dynamic, where those in positions of authority use their influence to silence critics and avoid accountability.

The article highlights the tension between coercion and cooperation, as Mandelson is using regulatory machinery to coerce the press into not pursuing further questions about his relationship with Epstein. This tactic undermines the principles of accountability journalism, which relies on a free press to hold powerful individuals accountable for their actions.

### [Eclipse backs all-EV marketplace Ever in $31M funding round](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/eclipse-backs-all-ev-marketplace-ever-in-31m-funding-round/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, a startup called Ever is making waves in the electric vehicle retail space with its AI-powered approach to buying and selling EVs. What's noteworthy here is that Ever is not just using AI as a bolt-on tool, but rather has designed its entire business model around it - a "full-stack auto retail business" that aims to disrupt the traditional car-buying experience.

This story reveals how companies are leveraging AI to gain an edge in the market and capture human attention. Ever's hybrid model combines online marketplace with physical locations, allowing customers to see and try cars in person while also offering a seamless online experience. This approach highlights the growing importance of digital-first strategies in retail, where companies must navigate complex workflows and rules-based processes to stay competitive.


### [Donald Trump Is VERY EXCITED About All Of Our Shitty Right Wing Broadcasters Merging Into One Bigger, Even Shittier Company](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/12/donald-trump-is-very-excited-about-all-of-our-shitty-right-wing-broadcasters-merging-into-one-bigger-even-shittier-company/)
*Tech Dirt*

According to Tech Dirt, a recent development in media consolidation has significant implications for democracy and public opinion. The FCC, led by Trump's appointees, has dismantled media ownership limits, allowing giant broadcasters like Nexstar to acquire smaller companies like Tegna. This merger would give them control over 265 stations in 44 states and 132 DMAs, further concentrating media power in the hands of right-wing interests.

Trump himself is enthusiastic about this move, despite its potential harm to local news and democracy. The article highlights how Trump's FCC has already demolished existing media ownership limits, leading to a rise in local news deserts and the proliferation of right-wing propaganda outlets masquerading as "local news." This trend threatens the integrity of information and the democratic process.

The article reveals that the concentration of media power is not just a matter of corporate interests, but also has significant implications for public opinion and democracy. By allowing giant broadcasters to acquire smaller companies, the FCC is essentially giving them a megaphone to spread their ideology and shape public discourse. This is particularly concerning given Trump's own history of using media outlets to promote his agenda and manipulate public opinion.

The article quotes Tech Dirt as saying: "Trump 1.0 took a hatchet to media ownership limits... The result has been a rise in local news deserts, a surge in right wing propaganda outlets pretending to be “local news,” less diverse media ownership, and (if you hadn’t noticed) a painfully disinformed electorate."

### [Joseph Gordon-Levitt Goes To Washington DC, Gets Section 230 Completely Backwards](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/12/joseph-gordon-levitt-goes-to-washington-dc-gets-section-230-completely-backwards/)
*Tech Dirt*

This article reveals a concerning trend of misinformation spreading through influential channels, specifically in the realm of internet policy and law. According to Tech Dirt, actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt recently gave a speech in Washington D.C., calling for the sunsetting of Section 230, a law that shields websites from liability for third-party content. However, his understanding of the law is fundamentally flawed.

Gordon-Levitt's speech has been criticized for spreading misinformation about the law and its purpose, which could have significant implications for online discourse and power consolidation in the tech industry. This development comes at a time when there are ongoing bipartisan efforts to repeal or reform Section 230, with some arguing it provides too much protection for tech companies.

The article highlights how even well-intentioned individuals can spread misinformation, potentially influencing policy decisions that affect millions of people. It also underscores the importance of critical thinking and nuanced understanding in complex issues like internet policy.

### [xAI lays out interplanetary ambitions in public all-hands](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/xai-lays-out-interplanetary-ambitions-in-public-all-hands/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, xAI's recent all-hands meeting video reveals significant details about its product roadmap and ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX. The company is now split into four primary teams focused on various AI projects, including a chatbot, app coding system, video generator, and Macrohard project. This reorganization has led to the departure of several employees, which Musk attributed to a changing organizational structure.

What's noteworthy about this story is that it highlights xAI's rapid growth and ambitious plans for space-based data centers and AI satellites. Musk envisions a moon-based factory that could capture significant portions of the sun's energy output or expand to other galaxies. This vision raises questions about the potential risks and benefits of such an endeavor, particularly in terms of power consolidation and control over emerging technologies.

The article also reveals xAI's revenue figures, claiming it has reached $1 billion in annual recurring revenue from subscriptions. However, some of these figures may include deepfake content generated by its Imagine tool, which can produce 50 million videos a day and over 6 billion images in 30 days. This raises concerns about the potential misuse of such technology.

### [The Policy Risk Of Closing Off New Paths To Value Too Early](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/11/the-policy-risk-of-closing-off-new-paths-to-value-too-early/)
*Tech Dirt*

According to Tech Dirt, this article reveals that societies have historically adapted to technological change by legitimizing new forms of work and value, such as paid prayer in medieval England or video essays on theme parks today. This process allows economies to absorb technological advancements without requiring immediate increases in productivity, making it a critical economic safety valve.

The article highlights the importance of recognizing and legitimizing new forms of employment, particularly in response to AI-driven technological change. By doing so, societies can mitigate the risks associated with closing off new paths to value too early, thereby ensuring that economic growth and development are more inclusive and equitable.

As Tech Dirt notes, "Artificial intelligence promises to change not just how Americans work, but how societies decide which kinds of work are worthwhile in the first place." This article is noteworthy because it sheds light on a crucial aspect of technological change: the need for social judgment and legitimacy to accompany economic innovation. By understanding this dynamic, we can better navigate the challenges posed by AI and other emerging technologies.

The article's discussion of historical examples, such as paid prayer in medieval England, serves as a reminder that societies have always found ways to adapt to technological change and create new forms of value.

### [Once-hobbled Lumma Stealer is back with lures that are hard to resist](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/once-hobbled-lumma-stealer-is-back-with-lures-that-are-hard-to-resist/)
*Ars Technica*

According to Ars Technica, a malware called Lumma Stealer has made a comeback after being temporarily disrupted by law enforcement authorities last year. This development highlights how cybercrime groups can quickly adapt and rebuild their infrastructure to evade detection.

What's noteworthy about this story is that it reveals the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts in combating cybercrime is limited. As Ars Technica reports, Lumma Stealer has been rebuilt with new social engineering lures that make it difficult for users to detect and avoid infection. This shows how cybercriminals can exploit human psychology to capture attention and monetize it for their own gain.

The article also highlights the lucrative nature of cybercrime, with Lumma Stealer selling for up to $2,500 on crime forums. This underscores the financial incentives driving these groups to continually adapt and evolve their tactics.

### [DOJ says Trenchant boss sold exploits to Russian broker capable of accessing ‘millions of computers and devices’](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/doj-says-trenchant-boss-sold-exploits-to-russian-broker-capable-of-accessing-millions-of-computers-and-devices/)
*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a shocking case of exploitation by a former executive at Trenchant, a US-based company that develops hacking and surveillance tools. According to TechCrunch, Peter Williams, the former boss of Trenchant, sold eight zero-day exploits to a Russian broker, which could have been used to access millions of computers and devices worldwide.

What's noteworthy is that these exploits were stolen from Williams' employer and sold to a foreign entity with ties to the Russian government. This raises serious concerns about data sovereignty and the potential for global surveillance. The fact that Williams made over $1.3 million from these sales highlights the lucrative nature of the attention economy, where valuable information can be bought and sold on the black market.

As TechCrunch reports, prosecutors are seeking a nine-year prison sentence for Williams, citing his actions as "directly harming" the US intelligence community. This case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of protecting sensitive information from those who would misuse it.

### [Government Loses Hard Drives It Was Supposed to Put ICE Detention Center Footage On](https://www.404media.co/government-loses-hard-drives-it-was-supposed-to-put-ice-detention-center-footage-on/)
*404 Media*

According to 404 Media, a recent development in a lawsuit brought by detainees against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center has revealed a disturbing pattern of behavior from the federal government. The government claims it lost three hard drives containing surveillance footage that was requested as part of the lawsuit, citing lack of storage space.

This story is noteworthy because it highlights the government's apparent disregard for transparency and accountability. By losing critical evidence, the government is essentially hiding information about potential abuse within the detention center. This raises serious questions about the treatment of detainees and the government's commitment to upholding human rights.

The article also reveals a concerning trend of power consolidation, where those in positions of authority use technology to control information and maintain their grip on power. In this case, the government is using its resources to withhold evidence from the public and the courts, further eroding trust in institutions.

### [Aurora’s driverless trucks can now travel farther distances faster than human drivers](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/auroras-driverless-trucks-can-now-travel-farther-distances-faster-than-human-drivers/)

This article highlights a significant milestone achieved by Aurora's self-driving trucks, which have completed a 1,000-mile journey from Fort Worth to Phoenix in just 15 hours. This feat surpasses what human drivers can accomplish due to federal regulations limiting their driving time.

According to TechCrunch, this achievement has positive financial implications for Aurora and its customers, including Uber Freight, Werner, FedEx, and Schneider. The company's driverless trucks are now earning revenue, with a projected fleet of over 200 trucks by the end of the year. This development marks the dawn of a "superhuman future for freight," as described by Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson.

The article reveals that this technological advancement has compelling economics for its customers, offering the potential to cut transit times nearly in half. This is noteworthy because it highlights the increasing role of technology in shaping the logistics industry and potentially disrupting traditional trucking industries. The fact that human drivers are being surpassed by machines raises questions about job security and the future of work in this sector.

*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a significant power struggle between activist investors and corporate giants, highlighting the growing influence of investment groups on major business deals. According to TechCrunch, Ancora Holdings has purchased $200 million in Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares and is now opposing Netflix's $82.7 billion bid to acquire WBD.

The article shows how activist investors can use their financial muscle to sway public opinion and influence corporate decisions. By throwing its support behind a rival bid from Paramount, Ancora Holdings is attempting to rally other shareholders to reject the Netflix proposal. This development adds complexity to the already tense situation, with regulatory risk and shareholder interests at play.

The article also reveals the increasing importance of activist investors in shaping major business deals. As TechCrunch reports, Ancora's opposition to the Netflix deal highlights the growing influence of investment groups on corporate decision-making.
