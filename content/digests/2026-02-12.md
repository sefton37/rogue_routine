## The Big Picture
Today's top stories reveal a complex web of power dynamics at play in the attention economy. On one hand, we see government agencies pushing boundaries to control data and information, from the US FTC expressing concerns over Apple News' alleged suppression of right-wing content to the South Korean government facing lawsuits over its handling of Coupang's data breach. Meanwhile, tech giants like OpenAI are grappling with their own power struggles, as seen in the resignation of a researcher over ChatGPT ads and the company's decision to disband its mission alignment team. These stories highlight the tension between corporate interests and public well-being, particularly when it comes to sensitive information like patient data or online expression.

## Deep Dives

### [Pluralistic: Doctors' union may yet save the NHS from Palantir (12 Feb 2026)](https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/12/palantir-is-ice/)
*Interconnects*

This article, published by Interconnects, reveals a concerning power dynamic at play within the UK's National Health Service (NHS). According to the piece, the Labour government has chosen to partner with Palantir, a US military contractor accused of ties to the Trump regime, to manage NHS patient records. This decision has sparked outrage among doctors and healthcare professionals.

The article highlights that OpenSAFELY, an open-source alternative developed by Ben Goldacre and his team at Jesus College Oxford, was passed over in favor of Palantir's solution. This raises questions about the Labour government's priorities and whether they are prioritizing the interests of private contractors over those of the NHS and its patients.

The story matters because it exposes a potential threat to patient data sovereignty and highlights the risks associated with outsourcing sensitive information to companies with questionable ethics. It also underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in decision-making processes, particularly when it comes to healthcare systems.

As Interconnects reports, the doctors' union may yet save the NHS from Palantir's control. This development suggests that there are still opportunities for resistance and pushback against decisions that prioritize corporate interests over public well-being.

The article also touches on the issue of systemic design, highlighting how Labour's decision-making process has led to a situation where private contractors have more influence over NHS operations than healthcare professionals themselves. This is a concerning trend that warrants further scrutiny and attention.

Ultimately, this story serves as a reminder of the need for robust safeguards and regulations around data management in the public sector, particularly when it comes to sensitive information like patient records.

### [More US investors sue South Korean government over handling of Coupang data breach](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/more-u-s-investors-sue-south-korean-government-over-handling-of-coupang-data-breach/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, a growing number of US investors in Coupang, a South Korean e-commerce company, are suing the South Korean government over its handling of a massive data breach that exposed nearly 34 million customers' personal information. This story matters because it reveals a power struggle between foreign investors and a national government, with significant implications for data sovereignty and international trade.

The article highlights how the South Korean government has been applying extraordinary pressure on Coupang, threatening massive fines, suspension of operations, and even travel bans for executives. Meanwhile, the US investors are seeking international arbitration under the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA), alleging that the government acted unlawfully towards the company. This dispute is a prime example of how the attention economy can be used as a tool for power consolidation, with governments exerting control over data and its flow.

The story also underscores the systemic problem of fear-based systems in international trade and investment. The South Korean government's actions against Coupang are motivated by a desire to protect national interests, but this approach risks creating a chilling effect on foreign investment and undermining trust in the country's business environment.

As TechCrunch reports, "the breach involved customer names, email addresses, phone numbers, shipping addresses, and certain order histories." This incident is just one example of how data breaches can have far-reaching consequences for individuals and businesses alike. The article does not provide a clear quote from any party involved in the dispute, but it highlights the complexity and sensitivity of this issue.

Overall, this story matters because it reveals the intricate web of power dynamics at play in the attention economy, where governments, corporations, and investors are all vying for control over data and its flow. As international trade and investment continue to evolve, we can expect more disputes like this one to emerge, highlighting the need for greater transparency, accountability, and cooperation between nations.

### [The System Of Checks And Balances Doesn’t Work When One Branch Refuses To Play By The Rules](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/11/the-system-of-checks-and-balances-doesnt-work-when-one-branch-refuses-to-play-by-the-rules/)
*Tech Dirt*

This article, published by Tech Dirt, reveals a disturbing trend of power consolidation and erosion of individual rights in the US government. According to Tech Dirt, the system of checks and balances has broken down due to one branch (the executive) refusing to play by the rules. The judicial branch has become complicit in allowing executive overreach, while the legislative branch is compromised by MAGA bootlickers who refuse to hold the executive accountable.

The article highlights a specific case where a Guatemalan resident of Minnesota was detained and mistreated by ICE despite a court-ordered release. This incident illustrates how the executive branch can disregard individual rights with impunity. The author argues that this is not an isolated instance, but rather a symptom of a broader problem: the judicial branch's complicity in allowing executive overreach.

The article emphasizes the importance of checks and balances in preventing any one branch from abusing its power. However, it also reveals how these safeguards can be circumvented when one branch refuses to play by the rules. The author notes that even judges have become complicit in this system, with some openly expressing contempt for the judicial system they are a part of.

This story matters because it exposes the dangers of unchecked executive power and the erosion of individual rights. It highlights how the current system can be manipulated to serve the interests of those in power, rather than protecting the rights of citizens. The article also underscores the importance of a functional system of checks and balances in preventing such abuses of power.

Tech Dirt reports that this situation is not only a threat to individual rights but also undermines the very foundation of democracy.

### [OpenAI researcher quits over ChatGPT ads, warns of "Facebook" path](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/openai-researcher-quits-over-fears-that-chatgpt-ads-could-manipulate-users/)
*Ars Technica*

According to Ars Technica, a former OpenAI researcher has resigned from the company due to concerns over its advertising strategy for ChatGPT. Zoë Hitzig argues that the ads risk exploiting users' personal data, which they shared with the chatbot under the assumption of confidentiality.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals the tension between economic incentives and user privacy in the development of AI-powered technologies. As Hitzig warns, "I once believed I could help the people building A.I. get ahead of the problems it would create," but now she fears that OpenAI's pursuit of profit will lead to a repeat of Facebook's mistakes.

Hitzig's resignation highlights the growing debate over advertising in AI chatbots and raises questions about the long-term implications for users' privacy. As Ars Technica reports, Hitzig is concerned that OpenAI's accumulated record of personal disclosures from ChatGPT users has no precedent, making it a potentially valuable resource for advertisers.

This development is significant because it underscores the need for greater transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of AI-powered technologies.

### [🗣 Homeland Security Wants Names | EFFector 38.3](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/homeland-security-wants-names-effector-383)
*EFF*

According to EFF, the Department of Homeland Security is using administrative subpoenas to demand that tech companies hand over users' names, locations, and other information. This move raises concerns about government overreach and the erosion of online privacy.

The article reveals a worrying trend where the government is abusing its power to collect personal data from citizens without proper justification or oversight. EFF's advocacy for stronger protections against unlawful surveillance highlights the need for tech companies to stand up for their users' rights and resist these subpoenas. The story matters because it shows how the government is using coercion to gather information, rather than working with tech companies through cooperation.

> "Criticize the government online? The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) might ask Google to cough up your name."
— [EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/homeland-security-wants-names-effector-383)


This quote illustrates the chilling effect that such demands can have on free speech and online expression. By making it clear that criticizing the government online can lead to personal data being handed over, DHS is effectively silencing citizens who dare to speak out against its policies.

### [Peter Mandelson Invokes Press Harassment Protections To Dodge Questions About His Support Of Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/11/peter-mandelson-invokes-press-harassment-protections-to-dodge-questions-about-his-support-of-jeffrey-epstein/)
*Tech Dirt*

According to Tech Dirt, Peter Mandelson has used press harassment protections to avoid answering questions about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This move is noteworthy because it highlights how individuals in positions of power can manipulate regulatory machinery to shield themselves from public scrutiny.

Mandelson's use of these protections demonstrates a clear attempt to consolidate power and control the narrative around his relationship with Epstein. By invoking press harassment protections, he is essentially using fear-based systems to silence journalists and prevent them from holding him accountable for his actions. This dynamic reveals the tension between coercion and cooperation in modern society, where those in power can use regulatory mechanisms to stifle criticism and maintain their grip on control.

The article also highlights the importance of accountability journalism in a functioning democracy. By reporting on Mandelson's attempts to avoid scrutiny, Tech Dirt is holding him accountable for his actions and shedding light on the ways in which power is exercised in society. This kind of reporting is essential for maintaining transparency and ensuring that those in positions of power are held responsible for their actions.

> "Mr Mandelson’s representatives state that he does not wish to speak to the media at this time." — [Tech Dirt](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/11/peter-mandelson-invokes-press-harassment-protections-to-dodge-questions-about-his-support-of-jeffrey-epstein/)

### [Eclipse backs all-EV marketplace Ever in $31M funding round](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/eclipse-backs-all-ev-marketplace-ever-in-31m-funding-round/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, a startup called Ever is trying to revolutionize the way people buy and sell electric vehicles (EVs) with its AI-powered platform. What's notable here is that Ever's approach goes beyond just adding AI tools to an existing business model - it's building a new kind of retail experience from scratch.

Ever's platform combines online and offline experiences, allowing customers to browse and purchase EVs in a seamless way. The company has already attracted thousands of customers, and its $31 million funding round suggests that investors believe it can scale this new model successfully.

### [Donald Trump Is VERY EXCITED About All Of Our Shitty Right Wing Broadcasters Merging Into One Bigger, Even Shittier Company](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/12/donald-trump-is-very-excited-about-all-of-our-shitty-right-wing-broadcasters-merging-into-one-bigger-even-shittier-company/)
*Tech Dirt*

According to Tech Dirt, a recent merger proposal between Nexstar and Tegna would give control over 265 stations in 44 states and 132 DMAs to one company. This move is seen as a step towards creating an even larger media giant that would further concentrate power in the hands of right-wing interests.

The article reveals how the FCC, led by Trump's appointees, has dismantled media ownership limits, allowing for this consolidation. Trump himself has expressed enthusiasm for the merger, despite its potential to harm local news and democracy. This story is noteworthy because it highlights the worrying trend of media giants concentrating power under the control of unethical individuals, threatening the integrity of information and the democratic process.

This quote from the article underscores how Trump's actions have led to a decline in local journalism and an increase in misinformation.

### [Joseph Gordon-Levitt Goes To Washington DC, Gets Section 230 Completely Backwards](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/12/joseph-gordon-levitt-goes-to-washington-dc-gets-section-230-completely-backwards/)
*Tech Dirt*

This article reveals a concerning trend where influential figures are spreading misinformation about critical internet policies, specifically Section 230. According to Tech Dirt, actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt recently gave a speech in Washington D.C., calling for the sunsetting of Section 230, but his understanding of the law is fundamentally flawed.

Gordon-Levitt's speech has been criticized for spreading misinformation about the purpose and implications of Section 230. This development comes at a time when there are ongoing bipartisan efforts to repeal or reform Section 230, with some arguing it provides too much protection for tech companies. Tech Dirt reports that Gordon-Levitt's speech is not only misinformed but also compounds the errors in his follow-up video.

This story matters because it highlights the power of misinformation in shaping public discourse and policy decisions. It also reveals how influential figures can inadvertently (or intentionally) spread flawed ideas, which can have far-reaching consequences for online discourse and internet governance. As Tech Dirt notes, Gordon-Levitt's speech is not just a mistake but a symptom of a larger issue where people with influence are taking on complex topics without proper understanding.

> "You may have heard last week that actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt went to Washington DC and gave a short speech at an event put on by Senator Dick Durbin calling for the sunsetting of Section 230. It’s a short speech, and it gets almost everything wrong about Section 230." — Tech Dirt

*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, xAI's recent all-hands meeting video reveals significant details about its product roadmap and organizational changes. The company has split into four primary teams focused on various AI projects, including a chatbot, app coding system, video generator, and Macrohard project. This restructuring comes with a cost, as Musk attributed the departure of several employees to a changing organizational structure.

The article highlights xAI's ambitious plans for space-based data centers and AI satellites, which Elon Musk envisions could capture significant portions of the sun's energy output or expand to other galaxies.

*Tech Dirt*

According to Tech Dirt, this article reveals that societies have historically adapted to technological change by legitimizing new forms of work and value. This process allows economies to absorb technological advancements without requiring immediate increases in productivity, making it a critical economic safety valve.

The article highlights how AI is changing the nature of work and creating challenges for societies to legitimize certain forms of employment. By looking at historical examples such as paid prayer in medieval England and video essays on theme parks today, Tech Dirt reports that this mechanism has been essential for economic adjustment and has been overlooked in discussions about the impact of AI on work.

> "Artificial intelligence promises to change not just how Americans work, but how societies decide which kinds of work are worthwhile in the first place." — [The Policy Risk Of Closing Off New Paths To Value Too Early](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/11/the-policy-risk-of-closing-off-new-paths-to-value-too-early/)

### [Once-hobbled Lumma Stealer is back with lures that are hard to resist](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/once-hobbled-lumma-stealer-is-back-with-lures-that-are-hard-to-resist/)
*Ars Technica*

According to Ars Technica, the malware known as Lumma Stealer has made a comeback after being hobbled by law enforcement authorities last year. This development reveals how cybercrime groups can adapt and rebuild their infrastructure quickly, making it challenging for law enforcement efforts to effectively combat cybercrime.

The article highlights how Lumma Stealer uses social engineering lures, such as fake CAPTCHAs, to infect Windows computers. This tactic is particularly effective in capturing human attention and exploiting vulnerabilities in user behavior. The malware's cloud-based model also allows it to operate with a high degree of flexibility and scalability, making it difficult to detect and disrupt.

The resurgence of Lumma Stealer underscores the ongoing struggle between cybercrime groups and law enforcement authorities. It highlights the need for more effective strategies to combat cybercrime, including improved cybersecurity measures and increased international cooperation.

### [DOJ says Trenchant boss sold exploits to Russian broker capable of accessing ‘millions of computers and devices’](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/doj-says-trenchant-boss-sold-exploits-to-russian-broker-capable-of-accessing-millions-of-computers-and-devices/)
*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a disturbing tale of how a former executive at US-based surveillance tech company Trenchant, Peter Williams, stole and sold eight zero-day exploits to a Russian broker. According to TechCrunch, these exploits could have been used to access millions of computers and devices worldwide, including in the US.

What's noteworthy is that this sale directly harmed the US intelligence community by putting sensitive information at risk of being exploited by a foreign government. This story highlights the dark side of the surveillance tech industry, where powerful companies like Trenchant sell tools that can be used for nefarious purposes. It also raises concerns about data sovereignty and the potential for global surveillance.

TechCrunch reports that Williams made over $1.3 million from the sales between 2022 and 2025, underscoring the lucrative nature of this illicit trade. This case serves as a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of holding those in positions of authority accountable for their actions.

### [Government Loses Hard Drives It Was Supposed to Put ICE Detention Center Footage On](https://www.404media.co/government-loses-hard-drives-it-was-supposed-to-put-ice-detention-center-footage-on/)
*404 Media*

This article highlights a disturbing example of power consolidation, where the government is using its control over information to maintain its grip on power. According to 404 Media, the federal government has lost three hard drives containing surveillance footage from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in suburban Chicago.

The government's actions are particularly egregious because they are refusing to provide critical evidence in a lawsuit brought by detainees alleging abuse within the facility. The article reveals that the government is more interested in controlling information than in upholding its obligations to transparency and accountability.

As 404 Media reports, "the federal government has claimed that 10 days of footage from within the facility, taken during a critical and highly contested period, was 'irretrievably destroyed'." This Kafkaesque absurdity is a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of holding those in authority accountable for their actions.

The article also highlights the government's willingness to use technology as a tool of control. By losing or destroying critical evidence, the government is able to maintain its narrative and avoid accountability for its actions. This is a classic example of how power can be exercised through the manipulation of information and the use of technology to suppress dissent.

### [Aurora’s driverless trucks can now travel farther distances faster than human drivers](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/auroras-driverless-trucks-can-now-travel-farther-distances-faster-than-human-drivers/)
*TechCrunch*

What makes this story noteworthy is that it highlights the potential for automation to disrupt traditional industries and create new economic opportunities. According to TechCrunch, Aurora's driverless trucks are now earning revenue for its customers, including major logistics companies like Uber Freight, Werner, FedEx, and Schneider. This achievement marks a significant step towards a "superhuman future for freight," as described by Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson.

The article also reveals the economic implications of this technological advancement, with potential benefits for customers in terms of reduced transit times and increased efficiency. However, it remains to be seen how this shift will impact traditional trucking industries and their workers.

### [Activist investor Ancora publicly opposes the WBD-Netflix deal](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/activist-investor-ancora-publicly-opposes-the-wbd-netflix-deal/)
*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a significant power struggle between two corporate giants, Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), with activist investor Ancora Holdings throwing its weight behind Paramount's rival bid. According to TechCrunch, Ancora claims that the Netflix deal is inferior, involves more regulatory risk, and doesn't deliver as much immediate cash to shareholders.

This story is noteworthy because it highlights the influence of activist investors in shaping corporate decisions and their ability to sway public opinion. By purchasing $200 million in WBD shares, Ancora has demonstrated its financial muscle and willingness to take a stand against the Netflix deal. This development adds complexity to the already tense situation, with Ancora seeking to rally other shareholders to reject the Netflix proposal.

— [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/activist-investor-ancora-publicly-opposes-the-wbd-netflix-deal/)

TechCrunch reports that Paramount has improved its bid by offering WBD shareholders a new incentive: $0.25 per share for each quarter the deal remains unclosed after December 31, 2026. This move is likely an attempt to outmaneuver Netflix and secure the acquisition of WBD.
