**The Big Picture**

Today's briefing reveals an intricate web of power dynamics, attention extraction, and systemic design. The dimensional profile indicates that **Attention Economy** is elevated (2.3/3), suggesting a heightened focus on extracting and manipulating user attention. This theme intersects with **Power Consolidation** (1.3/3) and **Coercion vs Cooperation** (1.0/3), hinting at the use of coercion or manipulation to maintain control over users.

The elevated score for **Systemic Design** (1.6/3) suggests that today's articles are discussing the underlying structures and incentives driving these dynamics. This is reinforced by the presence of **Data Sovereignty** (0.5/3), which indicates a growing concern about user data and its control.

## Deep Dives

It also intersects with power consolidation, as Facebook's dominance in the software industry is a key theme. The author highlights the potential for users to break free from dominant platforms by creating their own alternatives.

> "OG App is the coolest app you've never heard of... Back in 2022, two teenagers unilaterally disenshittified Instagram by making an 'alt-client' that restored all the parts of Insta that made it a success and blocked all the antifeatures that Meta crammed down users' throats after they had them locked in."

### "Premium: The Hater's Guide to Oracle" [16/21]

This article scores high on attention economy due to Oracle's complex contracts and aggressive sales tactics. It also intersects with power consolidation, as a result of its dominance in the software industry. The author highlights how Oracle's audits and control over customer data are key themes.

> "Once you let Oracle into your house, it never leaves... Canceling contracts is difficult, to the point that one Redditor notes that some clients agreed to spend a minimum amount of money on services without realizing..."

### "Administration Lied To Itself To Keep Pushing Its Fake ‘Tren De Aragua’ Terrorism Narrative" [15/21]

This article scores high on attention economy due to the manipulation of information by the Trump administration. It also intersects with power consolidation, as a result of its dominance in shaping public discourse. The author highlights how the narrative around Tren de Aragua is debunked by internal intelligence reports.

> "For months, it’s been clear the intelligence doesn’t back the claims made by the deliberately stupid leaders of the Trump administration... A leak of intelligence information last May forced the Director of National Intelligence — personified in this administration by the always incredible (in the bad way) Tulsi Gabbard — to forcefully deny the TdA findings compiled by the Intelligence Community she supposedly oversees."
— [Tech Dirt](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/29/administration-lied-to-itself-to-keep-pushing-its-fake-tren-de-aragua-terrorism-narrative/)
