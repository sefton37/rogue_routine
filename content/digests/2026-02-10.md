## Deep Dives

### [Coalition Urges California to Revoke Permits for Federal License Plate Reader Surveillance ](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/coalition-urges-california-revoke-permits-federal-license-plate-reader-surveillance)
*EFF*

According to EFF, a coalition of organizations is urging California Governor Gavin Newsom to revoke permits allowing federal agencies like Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to install automated license plate readers (ALPRs) along border highways. This invasive mass surveillance puts residents and migrants at risk of harassment, abuse, detention, and deportation.

The coalition argues that this is not just a matter of individual rights, but also a question of power consolidation. By allowing federal agencies to install ALPRs without proper oversight, California's government is essentially ceding control over its own borders and citizens' data to the federal government. This raises concerns about the erosion of state sovereignty and the concentration of surveillance powers in the hands of a few agencies.

The coalition's demand for revocation of permits also highlights the coercive nature of this surveillance system. By monitoring license plates, CBP and DEA can track individuals' movements and activities without their consent or knowledge. This is particularly concerning given the history of abuse by these agencies, including the brutal campaign against immigrants and U.S. citizens led by former USBP Chief Greg Bovino.

The article emphasizes the urgent need for action, citing the return of Bovino to the El Centro sector as a reason why California's government must take immediate steps to revoke permits and remove ALPRs from border highways. The coalition includes various organizations, including the California Nurses Association, ACLU California Action, and Project on Government Oversight, which underscores the broad range of concerns about this surveillance system.

Overall, this story matters because it reveals the power dynamics at play in the attention extraction economy. By allowing federal agencies to install ALPRs without proper oversight, California's government is essentially ceding control over its own borders and citizens' data to the federal government. This raises concerns about the erosion of state sovereignty, the concentration of surveillance powers, and the coercive nature of this surveillance system.

### [With Ring, American Consumers Built a Surveillance Dragnet](https://www.404media.co/with-ring-american-consumers-built-a-surveillance-dragnet/)
*404 Media*

According to 404 Media, Ring's Super Bowl ad promoted its "Search Party" feature, which uses AI to search for lost dogs across neighborhood cameras. This raises concerns about the potential misuse of this technology for surveillance and control. The company has a history of partnering with law enforcement and creating a culture of fear among users through its "Neighbors" app.

The article highlights how Ring's business model relies on fear-mongering and consumerism to sell its products, which can be easily repurposed for more sinister uses, such as tracking suspected criminals or undocumented immigrants. This is a concerning trend that reveals the power dynamics at play in the surveillance economy. By partnering with law enforcement and creating a culture of fear among users, Ring has effectively turned American consumers into participants in their own surveillance.

As Chris Gilliard, a privacy expert, notes, "a clumsy attempt by Ring to put a cuddly face on a rather dystopian reality: widespread networked surveillance by a company that has cozy relationships with law enforcement and other equally invasive surveillance companies." This quote reveals the tension between Ring's marketing efforts and the actual implications of its technology. The article emphasizes how Ring's features, such as Search Party, can be easily repurposed for more sinister uses, highlighting the need for greater scrutiny of these technologies.

The story matters because it reveals the ways in which corporations like Ring are exploiting consumer fears to sell products that further erode our right to privacy. By partnering with law enforcement and creating a culture of fear among users, Ring is effectively turning American consumers into participants in their own surveillance. This is a concerning trend that highlights the need for greater regulation and oversight of these technologies.

### [Brendan Carr Launches Fake Investigation Of ABC’s ‘The View’ Because They Haven’t Adequately Coddled Trumpism](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/10/brendan-carr-launches-fake-investigation-of-abcs-the-view-because-they-havent-adequately-coddled-trumpism/)
*Tech Dirt*

This article reveals a disturbing power dynamic between the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and media outlets in the United States. According to Tech Dirt, FCC boss Brendan Carr has launched a fake investigation into ABC's "The View" for allegedly violating equal time rules by not providing enough favorable coverage to right-wing ideology.

What's striking is that this move appears to be an attempt to intimidate media companies into self-censorship, rather than a genuine effort to enforce existing regulations. The article highlights how Carr's office is likely the source of the Reuters report announcing the investigation, and that the rule in question is a dated relic that would be difficult to enforce.

This story matters because it shows how government agencies can use their authority to manipulate public discourse and silence dissenting voices. By threatening media outlets with fake investigations, Carr is attempting to exert control over what information is shared with the public and how it's presented. This has serious implications for freedom of speech and the press, as well as the ability of citizens to access diverse perspectives and opinions.

Furthermore, this move also reveals a broader pattern of government intimidation and manipulation in the United States. The article notes that Carr's office has previously hinted at taking action against talk shows that don't provide "equal" time to Republican ideology, suggesting a coordinated effort to silence dissenting voices and promote a particular ideological agenda.

As Tech Dirt reports, Anna Gomez, the FCC's lone Democrat Commissioner, has criticized Carr's move as "government intimidation" rather than a legitimate investigation. This highlights the importance of having independent oversight and checks on government power, particularly in areas like media regulation where the stakes are high for freedom of speech and the press.

### [Pluralistic: The Nuremberg Caucus (10 Feb 2026)](https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/10/miller-in-the-dock/)
*Interconnects*

This article, published by Interconnects, reveals a deep concern about the erosion of democratic values and the rise of authoritarianism in America. According to the author, the Democratic Party's failure to hold officials accountable for their actions during the Trump regime is a major issue. The proposed "Nuremberg Caucus" aims to address this problem by gathering evidence of crimes and civil rights violations committed during that period.

The article highlights the need for accountability and the rule of law in a democratic society. By proposing a caucus to investigate and prosecute those responsible, the author emphasizes the importance of holding power accountable. This initiative is seen as a way for Democrats to "meet the moment" and confront authoritarianism head-on.

What's striking about this article is its emphasis on the parallels between the Trump regime and Nazi Germany. The author explicitly states that America's descent into authoritarian fascism is made worse by the Democratic Party's inaction, drawing a direct line from the failures of the 1930s to the present day. This comparison is not just rhetorical; it highlights the very real dangers of allowing extremist ideologies to take hold.

The article also reveals a power dynamic where the opposition party feels constrained by its lack of majorities in Congress. The author asks what can be done without those majorities, implying that even with limited resources, the Democratic Party must find ways to resist and challenge the Trump regime's authoritarian tendencies.

Overall, this article matters because it shines a light on the systemic problems facing America's democracy. It highlights the need for accountability, the rule of law, and the importance of confronting authoritarianism head-on. By drawing parallels with historical events, the author underscores the gravity of the situation and the urgent need for action.

### [EFFecting Change: Get the Flock Out of Our City](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/effecting-change-get-flock-out-our-city)
*EFF*

According to EFF, this article reveals a growing resistance against Flock's surveillance technology, which uses Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) to monitor citizens' movements. The company's contracts have quietly spread across the US, but cities are now rejecting them due to concerns over civil liberties and privacy.

The article highlights how Flock's technology has enabled surveillance of people seeking abortions, protesters exercising their First Amendment rights, and communities targeted by discriminatory policing. This is a clear example of how power dynamics play out in the attention economy: those with access to data and surveillance tools hold significant control over individuals' lives.

What matters here is that cities are choosing not to deploy Flock's technology, indicating a shift in public opinion towards prioritizing civil liberties over convenience and security. EFF's event aims to explore this resistance and successful campaigns that have stopped deployments, emphasizing the democratization of tools and access.

The article also reveals how Flock's technology captures human attention and data, which is then used for surveillance purposes. This raises concerns about the erosion of privacy and the concentration of power in the hands of companies like Flock.

> "Flock contracts have quietly spread to cities across the country. But Flock ALPR (Automated License Plate Readers) erode civil liberties from the moment they're installed."
— [EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/effecting-change-get-flock-out-our-city)


This quote highlights the insidious nature of Flock's technology, which is often presented as a tool for public safety but actually undermines citizens' rights.

Overall, this article matters because it shows how individuals and communities are pushing back against surveillance capitalism and fighting for their right to privacy. It also underscores the importance of critical thinking about the technologies we use and the power dynamics at play in the attention economy.

According to TechCrunch, Tem's platform has already achieved significant traction in the UK, with over 2,600 business customers signed up. This success demonstrates the potential for AI-powered platforms to transform industries and create new opportunities for innovation and growth.

### [Section 230 Turns 30; Both Parties Want It Gone—For Contradictory Reasons](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/09/section-230-turns-30-both-parties-want-it-gone-for-contradictory-reasons/)
*Tech Dirt*

This article from Tech Dirt reveals a concerning trend where both major parties in the US are working to repeal or reform Section 230, a law that shields websites from liability for user-generated content. According to Tech Dirt, this effort is driven by contradictory goals: Republicans want to eliminate moderation on platforms, while Democrats aim to increase it.

This story matters because it highlights how politicians are trying to exert control over online speech, despite the law's original intention of protecting smaller platforms from lawsuits. The article suggests that repealing or reforming Section 230 would lead to further consolidation of market power among tech giants, ultimately limiting free speech and innovation online.

It reveals how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act shields Yelp from liability for user-generated content, allowing it to host millions of reviews without fear of lawsuits. This is noteworthy because it shows how online platforms can balance free speech with moderation, and how laws like Section 230 enable this balance.

The article also emphasizes Yelp's commitment to defending reviewers' rights and preserving these protections in the face of legal threats from businesses. This matters because it demonstrates how companies can prioritize users' freedom of expression over commercial interests, and how they can work together with advocacy groups like EFF to protect online communities.

> "Section 230 helps make it possible for online communities to host user speech: from restaurant reviews, to fan fiction, to collaborative encyclopedias."
— [EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/internet-still-works-yelp-protects-consumer-reviews)

*TechCrunch*

**Daily Briefing:**

According to TechCrunch, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi claims that SaaS (Software as a Service) is not dead, but rather evolving with the rise of AI. This shift in perspective reveals a significant power dynamic at play: companies are adapting their business models to accommodate emerging technologies, rather than resisting or ignoring them.

Ghodsi's statements highlight the importance of adaptability and innovation in the face of technological change. As AI continues to transform user interfaces and potentially disrupt traditional SaaS businesses, companies like Databricks are positioning themselves for success by embracing this new landscape.

This article matters because it shows how established players in the tech industry are responding to the rise of AI. By analyzing this shift, we can better understand the evolving nature of power and control in the attention economy.

### [ChatGPT rolls out ads](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/chatgpt-rolls-out-ads/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, OpenAI has started testing ads in its ChatGPT app for US users on the Free and Go subscription tiers. This move is noteworthy because it reveals the growing tension between user trust and the need for revenue streams in AI-powered chatbots.

The article highlights how OpenAI is trying to balance user experience with advertising, claiming that ads won't influence chatbot responses and will be clearly labeled as sponsored content. However, this decision also raises concerns about data sovereignty, as users' conversations will still be used to optimize ad performance.

TechCrunch reports that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously expressed concerns about the impact of ads on user experience, but has now defended the decision, calling it "dishonest" to portray ads as disrupting conversations. This shift in tone suggests that OpenAI is prioritizing revenue over user trust, which could have long-term consequences for the way we interact with AI-powered chatbots.

The article also mentions Anthropic's Super Bowl ads mocking the idea of including ads in AI chatbots, highlighting the growing competition and tension between rival companies in this space. Overall, [ChatGPT rolls out ads](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/chatgpt-rolls-out-ads/) is a significant development that sheds light on the complex relationships between user trust, data sovereignty, and revenue streams in the attention economy.

### [Open Letter to Tech Companies: Protect Your Users From Lawless DHS Subpoenas ](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/open-letter-tech-companies-protect-your-users-lawless-dhs-subpoenas)
*EFF*

According to EFF, a recent open letter urges tech companies like Meta and Google to stand up for their users by resisting the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) lawless administrative subpoenas for user data. These subpoenas are being used to target individuals engaged in First Amendment activity, including those who have documented ICE's activities or criticized the government.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals a disturbing trend of government overreach and abuse of power. As EFF reports, DHS has issued these unlawful subpoenas despite knowing they will be challenged in court. The fact that some users were able to successfully challenge these subpoenas by taking them to court highlights the importance of tech companies standing up for their users' rights.

This quote from EFF drives home the point that the government is knowingly violating its own rules and abusing its power. The fact that DHS withdrew some of these subpoens when challenged in court suggests a lack of confidence in their legitimacy. This story matters because it shows how tech companies can play a crucial role in protecting their users' rights and freedoms, and highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability from government agencies like DHS.

### [Trump EPA reportedly seeks to revoke landmark air pollution rule](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/trump-epa-reportedly-seeks-to-revoke-landmark-air-pollution-rule/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, the Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking to revoke a landmark air pollution rule that was established in 2009. This move would effectively repeal federal regulations on six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, which are major contributors to climate change.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals a clear attempt by the Trump administration to consolidate power and manipulate public attention. By repealing this critical air pollution rule, the EPA is putting the interests of fossil fuel-powered industries ahead of public health and environmental concerns. This decision also highlights the systemic design flaw in regulatory policy, where short-term gains are prioritized over long-term consequences.

The article quotes Tesla as saying that the endangerment finding "was based on a robust factual and scientific record." This quote underscores the stark contrast between the Trump administration's stance on climate change and the overwhelming scientific consensus. The move is also likely to attract lawsuits and may take years to resolve, which will further delay action on climate change.

Overall, this story highlights the ongoing struggle for control over environmental policy and the manipulation of public attention by powerful interests.

### [India makes Aadhaar more ubiquitous, but critics say security and privacy concerns remain](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/india-makes-aadhaar-more-ubiquitous-but-critics-say-privacy-concerns-remain/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, India is expanding its digital identity system, Aadhaar, through a new app and offline verification framework. This move aims to give users more control over their personal data by allowing them to share limited information with various services. However, critics argue that this expansion raises concerns about security, consent, and the broader use of the massive Aadhaar database.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals how governments are increasingly relying on digital identity systems to exert control over citizens' lives. The Indian government's push for Aadhaar highlights the tension between convenience and individual rights in the face of rapid technological advancements. As more people rely on these systems, concerns about data security and consent will only grow.

The article also shows that even efforts to address long-standing risks associated with physical photocopies and screenshots of Aadhaar documents may not be enough to alleviate critics' concerns. The structural risks of the system remain a major issue, and it's unclear whether the new app and offline verification framework will truly democratize access or simply consolidate power in the hands of those who control the database.

### [On Its 30th Birthday, Section 230 Remains The Lynchpin For Users’ Speech](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/its-30th-birthday-section-230-remains-lynchpin-users-speech)
*EFF*

According to EFF, this article reveals that despite controversy over its protection of tech companies, Section 230 remains essential to online discourse and has been instrumental in shaping the internet, economy, government, and society. It highlights concerns about bipartisan proposals in Congress to repeal or sunset the law, which critics argue would not address issues with big tech's practices but rather cement their dominance and lead to more censorship of lawful speech.

This story is noteworthy because it sheds light on the power dynamics at play between governments, corporations, and individuals online. The article reveals that Section 230 has become a crucial safeguard for users' rights, allowing them to express themselves freely without fear of retribution from tech companies or government agencies. However, as EFF reports, this protection is under threat, highlighting the ongoing struggle for control over the internet and its impact on society.

*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a significant shift in the way YouTubers earn their living, according to TechCrunch. Many creators are no longer relying solely on ad revenue and brand deals, which can be unpredictable due to algorithm changes and policy shifts.

This shift is noteworthy because it highlights the growing entrepreneurial spirit among YouTubers. They're recognizing that their income streams are not sustainable in isolation and are instead building parallel businesses, such as product lines, brick-and-mortar ventures, and consumer brands.

TechCrunch reports that some of these side businesses are even growing faster and more sustainably than their YouTube channels. This trend suggests that creators are adapting to the attention economy's unpredictability by diversifying their income streams and investing in sustainable business models.

### [India orders social media platforms to take down deepfakes faster](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/india-orders-social-media-platforms-to-take-down-deepfakes-faster/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, India has introduced new regulations that require social media platforms to step up policing of deepfakes and other AI-generated impersonations. This move is significant because it shows how governments can exert control over global tech firms operating in their markets. By mandating stricter moderation practices and compressing takedown timelines, India's rules risk accelerating censorship online.

The article reveals a power dynamic where governments are increasingly asserting their authority over the attention economy. TechCrunch reports that platforms like Meta and YouTube will likely adopt similar compliance measures globally due to India's large market size. This development highlights the tension between free speech and content regulation in the digital age.

### [5th Circuit Says Due Process Rights For Immigrants No Longer Exist In Its Jurisdiction](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/09/5th-circuit-says-due-process-rights-for-immigrants-no-longer-exist-in-its-jurisdiction/)
*Tech Dirt*

This article reveals a significant threat to immigrant rights and due process in the US, particularly in the 5th Circuit's jurisdiction covering Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. According to Tech Dirt, the 5th Circuit has ruled that immigrants have no due process rights within its jurisdiction, contradicting over 3,000 court rulings across the country.

This decision is noteworthy because it allows for indefinite detention without bond, which will likely lead to more immigrants being detained in Texas. The ruling also reflects a concerning trend of power consolidation and institutional capture, where the government can use courts to strip individuals of their rights. As Tech Dirt notes, "a government could choose to declare certain people non-citizens in order to strip them of their rights," which is highly problematic in a nation built by immigration.


### [Hacked, leaked, exposed: Why you should never use stalkerware apps](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/hacked-leaked-exposed-why-you-should-stop-using-stalkerware-apps/)
*TechCrunch*

This article is a wake-up call about the dark side of the attention economy. According to TechCrunch, at least 27 stalkerware companies have been hacked or leaked customer data since 2017, exposing sensitive information about millions of people. This reveals how vulnerable individuals are when they use these apps, which often encourage abusive behavior.

The article highlights a disturbing trend where hackers and hacktivists target stalkerware companies to expose their activities and raise awareness about the dangers of these apps. As one hacktivist put it: "There is a whole shady industry for people who want to monitor and spy on their families." This quote reveals the sinister nature of these apps, which are marketed as tools for jealous partners but actually facilitate abuse.

This story matters because it shows how the attention economy can be exploited by malicious actors. The fact that stalkerware companies have been hacked multiple times highlights a lack of security and accountability in this industry. TechCrunch's reporting sheds light on the consequences of using these apps, which can lead to serious harm for individuals and their loved ones.

The article also underscores the importance of data sovereignty, as these breaches compromise personal data and highlight issues with data protection. By exposing the risks associated with stalkerware apps, this story serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked power in the digital realm.

*Tech Dirt*

According to Tech Dirt, this article reveals how a Republican congressman, Tony Gonzales, used a national TV show to defend deportation policies and shift attention away from a 5-year-old US citizen's asylum case. By asking "what about that five-year-old U.S. citizen?" without completing the thought, Gonzales sparked confusion and criticism.

This story is noteworthy because it highlights how politicians use language to manipulate public opinion and avoid accountability for their actions. The article shows how Gonzales' statement was designed to create a false equivalence between a hypothetical US citizen child and a real asylum seeker, in order to justify deportation policies that are widely criticized as cruel and unjust.

This article reveals a significant shift in the way large enterprises approach cybersecurity, according to TechCrunch. Vega Security, an AI-powered startup, is challenging traditional methods of threat detection by running security operations directly where data already lives, rather than storing it all in one place.

The current system, led by legacy tools like Splunk, has become too expensive and inefficient for cloud environments, says Shay Sandler, co-founder and CEO of Vega. This new approach could potentially democratize access to effective cybersecurity solutions for large enterprises, making them more cost-effective and scalable.

*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, Spotify's latest growth spurt is driven by its "Wrapped" campaign and new features on its free tier. This solid performance comes as the company expands beyond music streaming into podcasts, audiobooks, and even physical bookstores.

What this story reveals is that Spotify's business model is increasingly reliant on extracting attention from users through engaging content and personalized experiences. The Wrapped campaign, which rounds up stats and listening highlights for users, has become a key driver of user engagement, with over 300 million users participating and sharing their results on social media. This suggests that Spotify is using data-driven insights to create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) among its users, encouraging them to share their experiences and attract new followers.

The article also highlights the importance of subscription revenue for Spotify's growth, with an 8% increase in subscription revenue contributing to a 7% rise in overall revenue. This underscores the company's shift towards a more sustainable business model that prioritizes recurring revenue streams over ad-supported income. As Spotify continues to expand its offerings and user base, it will be interesting to see how this strategy plays out in the long term.


### [Immigrant women founders face double hurdle in Silicon Valley](https://restofworld.org/2026/immigrant-women-founders-vc/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feeds)
*Rest of World*

This article highlights a critical issue in Silicon Valley's startup ecosystem, where immigrant women founders like Sri Ramaswamy face biases and stereotypes that hinder their success. According to Rest of World, these entrepreneurs are often asked irrelevant questions about their background rather than being evaluated on the merits of their product or business plan.

The story reveals how power dynamics play out in the tech industry, with venture capitalists holding significant control over access to funding and resources. By focusing on Ramaswamy's identity rather than her innovation, these investors perpetuate a double standard that disadvantages immigrant women founders. This article is noteworthy because it sheds light on the systemic barriers that prevent underrepresented groups from participating in Silicon Valley's lucrative startup scene.

### [The first signs of burnout are coming from the people who embrace AI the most](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/the-first-signs-of-burnout-are-coming-from-the-people-who-embrace-ai-the-most/)
*TechCrunch*

**Daily Briefing:**

This article, published by TechCrunch, reveals a concerning trend in the tech industry. According to researchers at UC Berkeley, companies that heavily invest in AI tools are actually creating "burnout machines." Instead of freeing employees from work, AI is making their to-do lists expand and bleed into personal time.

The study found that workers who genuinely embraced AI started doing more because they could do it with the help of tools. However, this led to increased stress and fatigue as work began to seep into their free time. As one engineer put it, "You had thought that maybe, oh, because you can do these things, work would be easier... But no, it's just more."

This story is noteworthy because it challenges the industry's narrative that AI will save people from work. Instead, it shows how AI can intensify existing problems and create new ones. TechCrunch reports that this trend has significant implications for workers' well-being and highlights the need for a reevaluation of how we design work with AI.

The article suggests that the promise of AI-induced productivity gains is being used to justify longer working hours, rather than genuinely freeing people from drudgery. This raises important questions about power dynamics in the workplace and the consequences of prioritizing efficiency over human well-being.
