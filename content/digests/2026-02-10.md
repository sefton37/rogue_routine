## The Big Picture
Today's news reveals a complex interplay between power consolidation, technological advancements, and rights erosion. Federal agencies are pushing the boundaries of compliance, as seen in stories like "Coalition Urges California to Revoke Permits for Federal License Plate Reader Surveillance" and [5th Circuit Says Due Process Rights For Immigrants No Longer Exist In Its Jurisdiction](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/09/5th-circuit-says-due-process-rights-for-immigrants-no-longer-exist-in-its-jurisdiction/). Meanwhile, tech companies like Ring and Flock are exploiting user data for profit, highlighting the tension between corporate interests and individual rights. The attention economy is driving innovation, but also raising concerns about surveillance, censorship, and control.

## Deep Dives

### [Coalition Urges California to Revoke Permits for Federal License Plate Reader Surveillance ](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/coalition-urges-california-revoke-permits-federal-license-plate-reader-surveillance)
*EFF*

According to EFF, a coalition of organizations has urged California Governor Gavin Newsom to revoke permits allowing federal agencies like Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to install automated license plate readers (ALPRs) along border highways. This invasive mass surveillance puts residents and migrants at risk of harassment, abuse, detention, and deportation.

The coalition's demand reveals a power struggle between state and federal authorities over data sovereignty and control. By urging California to revoke permits, the coalition is pushing back against federal agencies' ability to collect and use personal data without consent or oversight. This highlights the tension between state and federal powers in the US, with some states resisting federal encroachment on their rights.

The article also reveals a disturbing pattern of coercion and abuse by federal agencies, particularly Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). The coalition's letter notes that CBP Chief Greg Bovino has led a "brutal campaign" against immigrants and U.S. citizens in the past, raising concerns about the potential for further harassment and abuse.

The EFF report emphasizes the urgent need for action, citing the return of CBP Chief Bovino to the El Centro sector as a reason for California to revoke permits immediately. This suggests that the coalition believes the situation is dire and that swift action is necessary to prevent further harm.

### [With Ring, American Consumers Built a Surveillance Dragnet](https://www.404media.co/with-ring-american-consumers-built-a-surveillance-dragnet/)
*404 Media*

According to 404 Media, Ring's Super Bowl ad showcased its "Search Party" feature, which uses AI to search for lost dogs across neighborhood cameras. This raises concerns about the potential misuse of this technology for surveillance and control. The article highlights how Ring has a history of partnering with law enforcement and creating a culture of fear among users through its "Neighbors" app.

The company's business model relies on fear-mongering and consumerism to sell its products, as seen in its partnerships with police departments across the country. Experts warn that features like Search Party can be easily repurposed for more sinister uses, such as tracking suspected criminals or undocumented immigrants. As one expert notes: "a clumsy attempt by Ring to put a cuddly face on a rather dystopian reality: widespread networked surveillance by a company that has cozy relationships with law enforcement and other equally invasive surveillance companies."
