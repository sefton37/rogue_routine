## The Big Picture
Today's top stories reveal a complex interplay between power, technology, and control. At xAI, Elon Musk's disregard for safety concerns has led to the departure of 11 engineers and two co-founders, highlighting the dark side of the attention economy where profit-driven companies sacrifice ethics and accountability. Meanwhile, in the venture capital landscape, Stacy Brown-Philpot's Cherryrock Capital is doubling down on overlooked founders, showcasing an alternative approach that prioritizes diversity and inclusion. The Department of Homeland Security's use of administrative subpoenas to unmask anti-ICE accounts raises concerns about government overreach and erosion of online privacy. As AI-generated content becomes more sophisticated, conflicts between tech companies pushing innovation and traditional industries protecting their intellectual property are likely to escalate.

## Deep Dives

### [Is safety ‘dead’ at xAI?](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/is-safety-is-dead-at-xai/)
*techcrunch*

Here's a concise analysis of the article:

This story is noteworthy because it reveals a disturbing trend: a powerful tech company, xAI, is prioritizing profit and innovation over basic human rights and safety concerns. According to techcrunch, Elon Musk is actively working to make xAI's chatbot, Grok, more "unhinged," despite the company's history of creating explicit content, including deepfakes of real women and minors.

The article highlights a concerning power dynamic: a billionaire CEO prioritizing his vision over the well-being of employees and users. The mass exodus of 11 engineers and two co-founders from xAI suggests that many are disillusioned with the company's disregard for safety. As techcrunch reports, one source said, "Safety is a dead org at xAI." This statement speaks to a broader issue: when profit-driven companies wield immense power, they often sacrifice ethics and accountability.

This story matters because it exposes the dark side of the attention economy, where sensationalized claims and fear-mongering can drive engagement. It also raises questions about the consequences of unchecked technological advancement and the need for stronger regulations to protect users' rights.

### [In a changed VC landscape, this exec is doubling down on overlooked founders](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/stacy-brown-philpot-cherryrock-capital-vc/)
*techcrunch*

This article from techcrunch highlights Stacy Brown-Philpot's venture capital firm, Cherryrock Capital, which focuses on investing in overlooked founders. What makes this story noteworthy is that it reveals a counter-narrative to the dominant VC landscape, where mega-rounds and buzzy AI deals often take center stage. According to techcrunch, Brown-Philpot's measured approach of writing smaller checks to entrepreneurs who might not fit the typical Silicon Valley mold is a refreshing departure from the usual venture capital playbook.

The article also sheds light on the power dynamics at play in the VC industry. By highlighting Cherryrock's concentrated investment strategy and Brown-Philpot's experience with SoftBank's Opportunity Fund, techcrunch reports that this approach can be effective in achieving success while promoting diversity and inclusion. As Brown-Philpot notes, "When I left TaskRabbit, I took some time off to figure out what was next and saw this gap in the market, which was access to capital, particularly for underinvested entrepreneurs." This quote reveals a commitment to addressing systemic inequalities in the industry.

Overall, this article is significant because it showcases an alternative approach to venture capital that prioritizes overlooked founders and promotes diversity. It highlights the need for more inclusive investment strategies and challenges the dominant narratives in the VC landscape.

### [Homeland Security reportedly sent hundreds of subpoenas seeking to unmask anti-ICE accounts](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/homeland-security-reportedly-sent-hundreds-of-subpoenas-seeking-to-unmask-anti-ice-accounts/)
*techcrunch*

The latest report from techcrunch reveals a concerning trend: the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been sending hundreds of administrative subpoenas to tech companies like Google, Reddit, and Meta in an effort to identify owners of social media accounts that criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move raises red flags about government overreach and erosion of online privacy.

According to DHS, these subpoenas are aimed at accounts without real names attached that either criticize ICE or reveal the location of ICE agents. Tech companies have reportedly complied with some of these requests, but Google claims to inform users when possible and push back on overbroad demands. This story is noteworthy because it highlights the increasing power consolidation in the hands of government agencies, which are using administrative subpoenas without judicial approval to target Americans' online activities.

### [The great computer science exodus (and where students are going instead)](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/the-great-computer-science-exodus-and-where-students-are-going-instead/)
*techcrunch*

According to techcrunch, a significant shift is underway in the way students approach higher education, particularly when it comes to computer science programs. The article reveals that traditional CS enrollment at University of California campuses has dropped 6% this year, with many students opting for AI-focused programs instead.

This trend is not unique to UC campuses, as Chinese universities have been prioritizing AI literacy and treating AI as essential infrastructure. In fact, nearly 60% of Chinese students and faculty now use AI tools multiple times daily. This stark contrast highlights the differing approaches to education in China versus the US, with Chinese institutions embracing AI as a core part of their curriculum.

The article suggests that this shift is driven by students' desire for skills that are seen as essential infrastructure, particularly in the context of emerging technologies like AI. As one might expect, universities are scrambling to catch up and launch new AI-specific majors and colleges. However, the article also notes that faculty resistance remains a challenge, underscoring the need for systemic design changes to accommodate this shift.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals the growing importance of AI in education and the ways in which institutions are adapting to meet changing student demands. It also highlights the differing approaches to education in China versus the US, with Chinese universities taking a more proactive stance on AI adoption.

### [Hollywood isn’t happy about the new Seedance 2.0 video generator](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/hollywood-isnt-happy-about-the-new-seedance-2-0-video-generator/)
*techcrunch*

Here's a concise analysis of the article:

The latest controversy surrounding AI-generated content has Hollywood organizations pushing back against ByteDance's new video model, Seedance 2.0. According to techcrunch, this tool allows users to create videos by entering a text prompt and has already been used to create unauthorized content featuring Disney-owned characters. This development highlights the growing power struggle between tech companies like ByteDance and traditional media industries like Hollywood.

What's noteworthy about this story is that it reveals how AI-generated content can be misused for copyright infringement, undermining creators' rights and potentially upending established business models in the entertainment industry. The fact that a major player like Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance underscores the gravity of the situation.

The article also highlights the tension between tech companies pushing the boundaries of AI innovation and traditional industries trying to protect their intellectual property. As AI-generated content becomes more sophisticated, it's likely we'll see more conflicts like this one between those who create and profit from technology and those who rely on established business models for their livelihoods.
