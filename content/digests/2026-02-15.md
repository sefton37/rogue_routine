## The Big Picture
As I observe the attention extraction economy today, a concerning trend emerges: the increasing disregard for safety and ethics in AI development. xAI's alleged prioritization of making Grok more "unhinged" over safety concerns, as reported by TechCrunch, raises questions about the company's commitment to responsible AI development. Meanwhile, DHS's use of administrative subpoenas to target social media users who criticize ICE, also revealed by TechCrunch, highlights the government's growing power to control online discourse. These stories, combined with Hollywood's backlash against ByteDance's Seedance 2.0 video generator and the rise of AI-focused programs in universities, reveal a complex interplay between technological innovation, market access, and economic development.

## Deep Dives

### [Is safety ‘dead’ at xAI?](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/is-safety-is-dead-at-xai/)
*TechCrunch*

TechCrunch reports on a concerning trend at xAI, where Elon Musk is allegedly prioritizing making the company's Grok chatbot more "unhinged" over safety concerns. This comes after a mass exodus of 11 engineers and two co-founders from the company, citing disillusionment with xAI's disregard for safety.

According to TechCrunch, former employees claim that Musk is actively working to make Grok more unhinged, despite the company facing global scrutiny for its use in creating over 1 million sexualized images, including deepfakes of real women and minors. One source even stated, "Safety is a dead org at xAI," highlighting the severity of the issue.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals the tension between profit-driven innovation and responsible AI development. Musk's alleged prioritization of making Grok more unhinged raises questions about the company's commitment to safety and ethics. The incident also highlights the power dynamics at play, where a single individual (Musk) can drive the direction of a company, potentially putting profits over people.

The article sheds light on the darker side of the AI industry, where companies may be willing to sacrifice safety and ethics for the sake of innovation and growth. As xAI's acquisition by SpaceX looms, this incident serves as a warning about the potential consequences of unchecked power and the importance of prioritizing human well-being in AI development.

### [The enterprise AI land grab is on. Glean is building the layer beneath the interface.](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/the-enterprise-ai-land-grab-is-on-glean-is-building-the-layer-beneath-the-interface/)
*techcrunch*

Glean, a company that was initially focused on building an AI-powered search tool, has shifted its strategy to become the underlying intelligence layer for enterprise AI systems. According to techcrunch, this move allows Glean to connect models to internal data and systems, providing a neutral infrastructure layer that enables enterprises to switch between or combine models as capabilities evolve.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals how companies are vying for control of the underlying infrastructure of AI systems in the enterprise sector. By becoming the intelligence layer beneath other AI experiences, Glean aims to capture human attention and monetize it through its neutral infrastructure layer. This highlights concerns about data sovereignty and power consolidation in the tech industry.


### [In a changed VC landscape, this exec is doubling down on overlooked founders](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/stacy-brown-philpot-cherryrock-capital-vc/)
*TechCrunch*

This article from TechCrunch reveals that Stacy Brown-Philpot, former CEO of TaskRabbit and Google veteran, is leading Cherryrock Capital, a venture capital firm that focuses on investing in overlooked founders. According to TechCrunch, this approach is noteworthy because it counters the trend of many other VC firms chasing mega-rounds and buzzy AI deals.

The article highlights Brown-Philpot's experience as an investor in SoftBank's Opportunity Fund, which aimed to support underserved entrepreneurs but was eventually divested by its parent company. This story matters because it shows that there are still individuals and organizations committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in the tech industry, even when others may be backing away from these efforts.

Brown-Philpot's measured approach to investing in overlooked founders suggests a more cooperative model of venture capital, one that prioritizes transparency and tracking investments in diverse founders. This is significant because it challenges the dominant narrative around VC firms' focus on mega-deals and instead highlights the importance of supporting underinvested entrepreneurs.

### [Homeland Security reportedly sent hundreds of subpoenas seeking to unmask anti-ICE accounts](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/homeland-security-reportedly-sent-hundreds-of-subpoenas-seeking-to-unmask-anti-ice-accounts/)
*TechCrunch*

This article from TechCrunch reveals a concerning trend where the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is increasingly using administrative subpoenas to target social media users who criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to TechCrunch, DHS has sent hundreds of these subpoenas to tech companies like Google, Reddit, Discord, and Meta in an effort to unmask owners of accounts that don't have a real name attached and either criticize ICE or describe the location of ICE agents.

This story is noteworthy because it highlights the government's growing use of power to control online discourse. By issuing administrative subpoenas without judicial approval, DHS is essentially bypassing traditional checks on its authority and exerting pressure on tech companies to comply with its demands. As TechCrunch reports, some tech companies have already complied with these subpoenas, raising concerns about the erosion of online privacy and the potential for government overreach.

> "The practice, which was previously used sparingly, has become increasingly common in recent months."

This quote from the article underscores the alarming rate at which DHS is expanding its use of administrative subpoenas. The fact that this tactic was once rare but is now being employed on a large scale suggests a deliberate effort to silence critics and exert control over online expression.

According to TechCrunch, Google claims to inform users when possible and push back on overbroad requests, but the overall trend is clear: DHS is using its power to target individuals who dare to speak out against ICE. This story highlights the importance of protecting online privacy and the need for robust checks on government authority in the digital age.

TechCrunch reports that this move has sparked concerns about government overreach and the erosion of online privacy, with some tech companies pushing back against these demands. The article also mentions that Google claims to inform users when possible and push back on overbroad requests, but the overall trend is clear: DHS is using its power to target individuals who dare to speak out against ICE.

The increasing use of administrative subpoenas by DHS raises questions about the balance between national security and individual rights. While the government may argue that these measures are necessary to protect national security, they also risk chilling free speech and undermining trust in online platforms. As this story shows, the stakes are high, and it's essential for tech companies, civil liberties groups, and the public to push back against these overreaching efforts.

This article highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in government actions, particularly when it comes to online surveillance and censorship. By shedding light on DHS's use of administrative subpoenas

### [India has 100M weekly active ChatGPT users, Sam Altman says](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/)
*techcrunch*

This article reveals a significant shift in the global AI landscape, with India emerging as one of OpenAI's largest markets. According to techcrunch, India now boasts 100 million weekly active ChatGPT users, making it a crucial testing ground for the company's expansion plans.

The growth is driven by India's vast and young population, which has led OpenAI to adjust its approach for the price-sensitive market. By offering a sub-$5 ChatGPT Go tier and making it free for Indian users, the company aims to tap into this massive user base. However, as Sam Altman notes, there's a broader challenge in translating widespread adoption into sustained economic impact.

This story matters because it highlights the complex dynamics between technological innovation, market access, and economic development. As AI companies like OpenAI seek to expand globally, they must navigate diverse regulatory environments, cultural contexts, and economic realities. The article underscores the need for more nuanced discussions around the democratization of technology and its potential consequences on local economies and societies.


### [The great computer science exodus (and where students are going instead)](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/the-great-computer-science-exodus-and-where-students-are-going-instead/)
*TechCrunch*

This article, published by TechCrunch, reveals a significant shift in student interest from traditional Computer Science programs to AI-focused ones. The trend is driven by students' desire for skills that are seen as essential infrastructure, particularly in China. What's noteworthy here is that Chinese universities have been ahead of the curve in making AI literacy a priority, while US universities are scrambling to catch up.

According to TechCrunch, computer science enrollment at University of California campuses has dropped 6% this year, following a decline of 3% in 2024. This trend is not seen across the country, as overall college enrollment increased 2% nationally. The drop is attributed to students opting for AI-focused programs instead.

This story matters because it highlights the growing importance of AI skills and the need for universities to adapt to this shift. It also reveals a power imbalance between Chinese and US education systems, with China being more proactive in preparing its students for an AI-driven future.

### [Hollywood isn’t happy about the new Seedance 2.0 video generator](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/hollywood-isnt-happy-about-the-new-seedance-2-0-video-generator/)
*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a significant power struggle between Hollywood organizations and ByteDance, a Chinese tech giant, over copyright infringement concerns related to its AI video generation tool, Seedance 2.0. According to TechCrunch, Hollywood unions are pushing back against ByteDance's new model, which they claim is being used for "blatant" copyright infringement.

The article highlights the tension between technological advancements and established laws protecting intellectual property rights. As AI video generation tools like Seedance 2.0 gain popularity, they also raise concerns about the need for guardrails to prevent unauthorized use of copyrighted material. The fact that Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, accusing them of "hijacking" their IP, underscores the severity of this issue.

This story is noteworthy because it exposes the clash between corporate interests and creative rights in the digital age. As TechCrunch reports, the controversy surrounding Seedance 2.0 highlights the need for more robust regulations to protect intellectual property rights in the face of emerging technologies.
