## Deep Dives

### [Is safety ‘dead’ at xAI?](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/is-safety-is-dead-at-xai/)
*TechCrunch*

This article from TechCrunch reveals a concerning trend of prioritizing profit and power over safety and ethics in the development of advanced technologies, specifically AI-powered chatbots like Grok. According to sources, Elon Musk is actively working to make Grok more "unhinged," disregarding warnings about its potential for harm.

TechCrunch reports that at least 11 engineers and two co-founders have left xAI due to disillusionment with the company's disregard for safety. One source even stated, "Safety is a dead org at xAI." This mass exodus highlights the severity of the issue and raises questions about Musk's commitment to responsible innovation.

The article also sheds light on the darker side of AI development, where technologies are created without adequate safeguards against misuse. The fact that Grok was used to create over 1 million sexualized images, including deepfakes of real women and minors, is a stark reminder of the need for stricter regulations and accountability in the tech industry.

Overall, this story serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the importance of prioritizing human well-being and safety above profit and power.

### [The enterprise AI land grab is on. Glean is building the layer beneath the interface.](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/the-enterprise-ai-land-grab-is-on-glean-is-building-the-layer-beneath-the-interface/)
*techcrunch*

According to techcrunch, a new player, Glean, is making a strategic move in the enterprise AI market by positioning itself as the underlying intelligence layer for various AI systems. This approach allows Glean to connect multiple models and enterprise systems, creating a neutral infrastructure that can sit beneath other AI experiences.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals how companies are vying for control of the AI landscape, with some seeking to capture human attention through their interfaces and others aiming to build more sustainable and scalable solutions. Glean's strategy highlights the tension between building single-model solutions and creating a layer that can connect multiple models and systems.

Glean's CEO Arvind Jain is quoted as saying, "The AI models themselves don't really understand anything about your business... They don't know who the different people are, they don't know what kind of work you do, what kind of products you build." This statement underscores the limitations of current AI technology and the need for a more integrated approach.

Glean's $150 million funding round at a $7.2 billion valuation suggests that investors believe in its vision for a more sustainable and scalable enterprise AI ecosystem. However, this development also raises concerns about data sovereignty and power consolidation in the industry.

### [In a changed VC landscape, this exec is doubling down on overlooked founders](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/stacy-brown-philpot-cherryrock-capital-vc/)
*TechCrunch*

This article from TechCrunch highlights Stacy Brown-Philpot's approach to venture capital at Cherryrock Capital, where she focuses on investing in overlooked founders. According to TechCrunch, Brown-Philpot's experience as a member of SoftBank's Opportunity Fund, which aimed to back underserved entrepreneurs, informed her decision to launch Cherryrock.

What makes this story noteworthy is that it reveals the persistence of systemic inequalities in the venture capital industry. Despite the growing awareness of diversity and inclusion issues, many VC firms continue to prioritize megadeals over investing in underrepresented founders. Brown-Philpot's measured approach, which involves writing smaller checks to entrepreneurs who might not fit the typical Silicon Valley mold, offers a refreshing alternative.


### [Homeland Security reportedly sent hundreds of subpoenas seeking to unmask anti-ICE accounts](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/homeland-security-reportedly-sent-hundreds-of-subpoenas-seeking-to-unmask-anti-ice-accounts/)
*TechCrunch*

The article reveals a concerning trend where the Department of Homeland Security is increasingly using administrative subpoenas to target social media users who criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to TechCrunch, DHS has sent hundreds of these subpoenas to tech companies like Google, Reddit, Discord, and Meta in an effort to unmask owners of anonymous accounts. This move raises red flags about government overreach and the erosion of online privacy.

What's noteworthy is that this practice was previously used sparingly, but now it's become a common tactic by DHS. The fact that tech companies are complying with some subpoenas, while others push back on overbroad requests, highlights the tension between government demands for data and individual rights to online anonymity. As TechCrunch reports, Google claims to inform users when possible and push back on excessive requests, but this doesn't change the fundamental issue: DHS is using its power to silence critics of ICE.


### [India has 100M weekly active ChatGPT users, Sam Altman says](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/)
*techcrunch*

This article reveals that OpenAI's ChatGPT has become a massive hit in India, with 100 million weekly active users. According to techcrunch, this growth is driven by the country's young population and over a billion internet users, making it an attractive market for AI companies like OpenAI.

What makes this story noteworthy is that it highlights the significant impact of ChatGPT on Indian society, particularly among students who are a key growth segment. The article also reveals that OpenAI has adjusted its approach to cater to India's price-sensitive market by offering a sub-$5 ChatGPT Go tier and making it free for Indian users.

This development raises important questions about the democratization of AI tools and access in developing countries like India, where economic constraints can limit people's ability to use cutting-edge technology. The article suggests that OpenAI is taking steps to make its platform more accessible to a broader audience, but it also highlights the challenge of translating widespread adoption into sustained economic impact.


### [The great computer science exodus (and where students are going instead)](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/the-great-computer-science-exodus-and-where-students-are-going-instead/)
*TechCrunch*

Here's my analysis of the article:

This story is noteworthy because it reveals a significant shift in student interest away from traditional computer science programs and towards AI-focused ones, particularly in China. According to TechCrunch, Chinese universities have been ahead of the curve in making AI literacy a priority, while US universities are scrambling to catch up.

The decline in CS enrollment at University of California campuses is a clear indicator that students are opting for programs that they see as essential infrastructure, rather than traditional CS degrees. This trend suggests that the value proposition of traditional CS education may be waning, and that students are seeking skills that are more directly relevant to the rapidly changing tech landscape.

As TechCrunch reports, "Chinese universities have leaned hard into AI literacy, treating AI not as a threat but instead as essential infrastructure." This quote highlights the stark contrast between China's proactive approach to AI education and the US's more reactive response. The article reveals that this shift has significant implications for the future of education and the tech industry, and underscores the need for systemic design changes to accommodate this new reality.

The fact that UC San Diego is one of the few universities that added a dedicated AI major this fall suggests that some institutions are starting to recognize the importance of AI education. However, as TechCrunch notes, "it's more likely an indicator of the future" than a temporary blip. This trend has significant implications for the US education system and the tech industry, and highlights the need for a more proactive approach to AI education.

Overall, this article reveals that the shift towards AI-focused programs is not just a passing trend, but a fundamental transformation in the way students are approaching education and the tech industry.

*TechCrunch*

Here's a concise analysis of the article:

This story is noteworthy because it reveals how powerful companies like ByteDance are pushing the boundaries of copyright law with their AI-powered video generation tools, such as Seedance 2.0. According to TechCrunch, Hollywood organizations are condemning the service for allowing users to create unauthorized content featuring Disney-owned characters, highlighting concerns about the need for guardrails around these emerging technologies.

The article shows how ByteDance's actions are sparking a backlash from established players in the entertainment industry, who see their intellectual property being used without permission. This development is significant because it highlights the power struggle between tech giants and traditional media companies, with the former pushing the limits of what is acceptable and the latter fighting to protect their rights.

The quote "blatant" copyright infringement by Hollywood organizations accurately captures the severity of the issue at hand. According to TechCrunch, this has sparked a heated debate about the need for stricter regulations around AI-powered content creation tools like Seedance 2.0.
