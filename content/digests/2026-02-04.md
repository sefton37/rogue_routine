### [Homeland Security is trying to force tech companies to hand over data about Trump critics](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/homeland-security-is-trying-to-force-tech-companies-to-hand-over-data-about-trump-critics/)
*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a concerning trend of power consolidation, where the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is using administrative subpoenas to demand user information from tech companies about individuals who criticize the Trump administration. According to TechCrunch, DHS has been targeting anonymous Instagram accounts that share posts about ICE immigration raids and those who have criticized Trump officials or protested government policies.

What's striking is that these subpoenas are not backed by a judge's authority or a court order, allowing investigators to seek a wealth of information about individuals without oversight. This raises significant concerns about the lack of judicial checks on executive power and the potential for abuse of authority.

The article highlights how tech companies often comply with these subpoenas voluntarily, which underscores the issue of data sovereignty. The fact that DHS is using administrative subpoenas to intimidate people who document immigration activity or criticize government actions also points to a broader strategy of suppressing dissenting voices.

As TechCrunch reports, at least four cases have been reported where Homeland Security withdrew its subpoena after the account owners sued to block the attempt. This suggests that there may be some pushback against these overreaching measures, but it's clear that more needs to be done to protect individuals' rights and prevent the erosion of their freedoms.

The use of administrative subpoenas in this context also raises questions about the First Amendment protections for free speech and assembly. As one ACLU representative noted, recording police and sharing that recording anonymously is a protected right under the First Amendment.

Overall, this article highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in government actions, particularly when it comes to surveillance and data collection. It's essential that we continue to monitor these developments and push back against any attempts to undermine our rights and freedoms.
