### [Homeland Security is trying to force tech companies to hand over data about Trump critics](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/homeland-security-is-trying-to-force-tech-companies-to-hand-over-data-about-trump-critics/)
*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a concerning trend of power consolidation, where the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is using administrative subpoenas to demand user information from tech companies about individuals who criticize the Trump administration. According to TechCrunch, DHS has been targeting anonymous Instagram accounts sharing posts about ICE immigration raids and those who have criticized Trump officials or protested government policies.

What's striking is that these subpoenas are not backed by a judge's authority or a court order, allowing investigators to seek a wealth of information about individuals without judicial oversight. This raises serious concerns about the lack of accountability and potential for abuse of power. As TechCrunch reports, "administrative subpoenas are issued by federal agencies, allowing investigators to seek a wealth of information about individuals from tech and phone companies without a judge's oversight."

This story matters because it highlights the tension between government control and individual rights in the digital age. The article emphasizes that recording police activity and sharing those recordings anonymously is protected under the First Amendment, yet DHS is trying to intimidate people who exercise this right by demanding their personal information.

The use of administrative subpoenas also reveals a broader pattern of systemic problems, where government agencies are increasingly using coercive tactics to silence critics and stifle dissent. As the American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern, this is part of a "broader strategy to intimidate people who document immigration activity or criticize government actions."

In this context, it's essential to recognize that tech companies often comply with these subpoenas voluntarily, which can have far-reaching implications for user data sovereignty and online freedom. As TechCrunch notes, "it's largely up to a company whether to give over any data to the requesting government agency." This highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in the way tech companies handle user data and respond to government requests.

Overall, this article serves as a stark reminder of the complex power dynamics at play in the attention economy. As we continue to navigate the intersection of technology, politics, and individual rights, it's crucial to stay vigilant about these issues and demand greater transparency and accountability from those in power.

*Tech Dirt*

This article reveals a concerning trend of media consolidation, where powerful individuals and institutions are using their influence to shape public opinion and control the narrative. According to Tech Dirt, the Trump administration is escalating its attacks on Netflix's proposed merger with Warner Brothers, allegedly to help Larry Ellison dominate the US media landscape.

The article highlights how the Trump administration is using false claims about "woke" ideology to justify its efforts, while critics argue that Netflix prioritizes profits over ideological consistency. This raises questions about the manipulation of public opinion and the use of propaganda to shape cultural narratives.

As Tech Dirt reports, Larry Ellison's media acquisitions are a key part of this strategy, aiming to create a safe space for right-wing ideology and propaganda. The article suggests that the Trump administration is willing to use its power to help Ellison achieve his goals, highlighting the dangers of unchecked corporate influence and government manipulation.

> "because they want Larry Ellison to be able to dominate media and create a safe space for unpopular right wing ideology" — [Tech Dirt](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/04/trumpland-ramps-up-attacks-on-netflix-warner-brothers-merger-to-help-larry-ellison/)

### [ICE Director Says Officers Are Now Allowed To Make Arrests Without Warrants](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/03/ice-director-says-officers-are-now-allowed-to-make-arrests-without-warrants/)
*Tech Dirt*

According to Tech Dirt, a recent memo from ICE Director Todd Lyons has given lower-level agents the authority to make arrests without warrants, expanding their ability to carry out sweeps and round up people suspected of being undocumented immigrants. This move is noteworthy because it reveals how the administration is using its power to undermine constitutional protections, specifically the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The article highlights how this change allows ICE agents to use a new standard of "likely to escape" as justification for warrantless arrests, which critics argue is an overreach of authority. This development is concerning because it shows how the administration is using its power to create a culture of fear and control, particularly targeting marginalized communities.

The article also notes that this move is part of a larger pattern of the administration disregarding due process and access to legal representation for those being detained. As Tech Dirt reports, "the administration's racist goon squads have absolutely been steamrolling the Constitution since Trump's return to office."
