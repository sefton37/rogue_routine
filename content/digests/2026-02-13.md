*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a power struggle between Automattic and WP Engine, two major players in the WordPress ecosystem. According to TechCrunch, WP Engine claims that Automattic's co-founder Matt Mullenweg planned to target 10 competitors with royalty fees for using the WordPress trademark.

What makes this story noteworthy is the alleged attempt by Mullenweg to exert control over other hosting companies and force them to pay royalties. This move can be seen as a form of coercion, where Automattic uses its dominance in the market to strong-arm others into submission. The fact that WP Engine claims Mullenweg tried to get payment processor Stripe to cancel their contract adds weight to this argument.

The article highlights the tension between open-source and proprietary business models, with Automattic's actions potentially undermining the principles of open-source software. As TechCrunch reports, Mullenweg believes WP Engine is profiting from WordPress without contributing back to the community, but it remains unclear whether this is a legitimate concern or simply a pretext for Automattic's aggressive tactics.

WP Engine's amended complaint against Automattic and Mullenweg raises questions about the balance of power in the tech industry. The fact that Automattic allegedly planned to target multiple competitors with royalty fees suggests a willingness to use its market position to stifle competition and maintain control.
