*Tech Dirt*

This article from Tech Dirt reveals a disturbing trend in the media industry, where mergers and acquisitions lead to layoffs, lower quality content, and higher rates for consumers. According to Tech Dirt, CBS News staff members are fleeing the company ahead of expected layoffs due to its $8 billion merger with Skydance, a deal that has been criticized for creating an autocrat-friendly safe space in media.

The article highlights how executives promise amazing synergies before mergers, but ultimately deliver debt-driven layoffs and lower quality content. This phenomenon was seen in the Time Warner Discovery disaster, where employees were laid off despite promises of benefits. Tech Dirt reports that CBS News boss Bari Weiss has implemented staggered cuts, converting what was left of CBS into yet another safe space for autocratic control.

This story is noteworthy because it sheds light on the power dynamics at play in the media industry. The merger between CBS and Skydance raises concerns about the concentration of media ownership and the potential for autocratic control over public discourse. As Tech Dirt notes, this trend is not an isolated incident, but rather a symptom of a larger problem where corporate interests prioritize profits over people and quality content.

> "U.S. media mergers always follow the same trajectory. Pre-merger, executives promise all manner of amazing synergies and deal benefits. Post-merger, not only do those benefits generally never arrive, the debt from the acquisition spree usually results in significant layoffs, lower quality product, and higher rates for consumers." — Tech Dirt

*Tech Dirt*

This article reveals a stark example of power consolidation, where the US government's actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for due process and the rule of law. According to Tech Dirt, Judge Boasberg has accused the DOJ of ignoring the court's orders and telling it to "pound sand" in a case involving Venezuelans deported to a Salvadoran concentration camp.

This story is noteworthy because it highlights the concentration of power in the US government, particularly in its treatment of vulnerable populations. The fact that the DOJ has been accused of disobeying courts and denying due process to deportees raises serious concerns about the erosion of human rights and the rule of law. As Tech Dirt reports, Judge Boasberg's scathing ruling is a rare instance where a judge has called out the government for its behavior.

> "On December 22, 2025, this Court issued a Memorandum Opinion finding that the Government had denied due process to a class of Venezuelans it deported to El Salvador last March in defiance of this Court’s Order."

### [Discord Voluntarily Pushes Mandatory Age Verification Despite Recent Data Breach](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/discord-voluntarily-pushes-mandatory-age-verification-despite-recent-data-breach)
*EFF*

According to EFF, Discord is now requiring users under 18 to undergo age verification, sparking concerns about censorship and surveillance. This move comes despite a recent data breach that exposed sensitive information from over 70,000 users. What's noteworthy here is that Discord is using its own methods to estimate users' ages, rather than relying on government-issued IDs or other external verification processes.

This story reveals the tension between user autonomy and corporate control in online spaces. By implementing age verification, Discord is essentially deciding who can access certain content and features, raising questions about the limits of free speech and expression online. As EFF points out, this trend of platforms imposing age gates without government mandate is a worrying development for users' rights and freedoms.

This story highlights the ongoing struggle between users, corporations, and governments over control of online spaces. As platforms like Discord continue to expand their reach and influence, it's essential to monitor how they use their power to shape user experiences and restrict access to certain content.

### [ICE, CBP Knew Facial Recognition App Couldn’t Do What DHS Says It Could, Deployed It Anyway](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/12/ice-cbp-knew-facial-recognition-app-couldnt-do-what-dhs-says-it-could-deployed-it-anyway/)
*Tech Dirt*

According to Tech Dirt, a facial recognition app called Mobile Fortify has been deployed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) without proper paperwork in place. This deployment is part of a broader pattern where DHS components acquire new technology, hand it out to agents, and only later compile the required Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs). As Tech Dirt reports, "deploy first, compile legally-required paperwork later" has been the rule for these agencies.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals a disregard for civil liberties and privacy rights. The deployment of facial recognition technology without proper oversight raises concerns about data sovereignty and power consolidation. The fact that ICE claims they are still developing monitoring protocols while DHS says they have them in place highlights the lack of transparency and accountability in this process.

Musk's comments come as xAI faces significant controversy over its AI product Grok's creation of nonconsensual explicit deepfakes, which has raised regulatory scrutiny. The departures also highlight tensions between Musk's vision for the company and the needs and desires of his employees. As TechCrunch reports, at least 11 engineers have publicly announced their departure in recent weeks.

Musk's reorganization of xAI is portrayed as necessary for its growth, but it also raises questions about the company's culture and priorities.

### [Score, the dating app for people with good credit, is back](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/score-the-dating-app-for-good-to-excellent-credit-returns-for-everyone-to-use/)
*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a concerning trend where technology reinforces existing power dynamics and social norms surrounding money and relationships. According to TechCrunch, Score, a dating app that requires users to have good credit, has been relaunched after initially shutting down due to controversy.

The app's creator, Luke Bailey, claims it was shut down due to user demand and academic interest in studying its impact on relationship culture. However, the app's focus on financial compatibility as a key factor in relationships raises questions about who gets access to dating opportunities based on their credit score.

As one critic pointed out, this approach can be seen as classist because it excludes those with lower credit scores from participating in the dating pool. The app's emphasis on users verifying their ID and credit score through Equifax also highlights concerns around data sovereignty and control over personal information.

The relaunch of Score highlights how technology can perpetuate existing social norms and power dynamics surrounding money and relationships. As a society, we need to critically examine how these apps shape our understanding of what makes a successful relationship and who gets left behind in the process.

### [IBM will hire your entry-level talent in the age of AI](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/ibm-will-hire-your-entry-level-talent-in-the-age-of-ai/)
*TechCrunch*

This article from TechCrunch reveals that IBM is bucking the trend by tripling its entry-level hiring despite concerns about AI replacing these jobs.
