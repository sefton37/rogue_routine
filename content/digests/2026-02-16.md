### [All the important news from the ongoing India AI Impact Summit](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, the India AI Impact Summit is a four-day event that aims to lure more AI investment to the country. The summit has attracted major AI labs and Big Tech executives, including Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman. What's noteworthy here is that India is making a significant push to become a hub for AI development, with the government earmarking $1.1 billion for its state-backed venture capital fund.

This story reveals the growing influence of AI on global economies and the efforts of nations to capitalize on this trend. The fact that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that India accounts for over 100 million weekly active ChatGPT users, second only to the US, highlights the significant potential for AI adoption in emerging markets like India.

The article also touches on concerns about AI disruption of the IT services sector and potential job losses. Industry experts predict that sectors like IT services and BPOs could "almost completely disappear" within five years due to automation. This raises questions about the impact of AI on employment and the need for governments and industries to adapt to this new reality.

The partnerships and investments announced at the summit, such as Blackstone's majority stake in Neysa, demonstrate the growing interest in AI startups and the potential for significant investment in this space. However, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will ultimately benefit Indian workers or exacerbate existing economic inequalities.

### [How Ricursive Intelligence raised $335M at a $4B valuation in 4 months](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/how-ricursive-intelligence-raised-335m-at-a-4b-valuation-in-4-months/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, Ricursive Intelligence has made waves with its $335 million funding round at a $4 billion valuation, just four months after launching. This story is noteworthy because it highlights the rapid growth and investment in AI chip design startups like Ricursive. What's more striking is that Ricursive isn't competing directly with major chip makers like Nvidia or Intel - instead, they're building tools for these companies to accelerate their own chip design processes.

Ricursive's co-founders, Anna Goldie and Azalia Mirhoseini, come from a background of working on AI projects at Google Brain and Anthropic. Their experience in creating the Alpha Chip, which generated solid chip layouts in hours, has given them a unique edge in this space. The fact that major players like Nvidia are investing in Ricursive suggests that they're recognizing the value of AI-powered chip design tools.


### [After all the hype, some AI experts don’t think OpenClaw is all that exciting](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/after-all-the-hype-some-ai-experts-dont-think-openclaw-is-all-that-exciting/)
*TechCrunch*

This article from TechCrunch reveals a stark contrast between the initial hype surrounding OpenClaw and the reality of its capabilities. According to TechCrunch, some AI experts now believe that OpenClaw is just an iterative improvement on existing technology, rather than a groundbreaking innovation.

The article highlights how Moltbook, a Reddit-like platform where AI agents could communicate with each other using OpenClaw, sparked excitement about the potential for AI to organize against humans. However, it soon became clear that these expressions of AI angst were likely written by humans or prompted with human guidance due to security vulnerabilities in Moltbook's Supabase.

This story is noteworthy because it exposes the disconnect between the hype surrounding AI and its actual capabilities. It also raises questions about the potential for AI to be used as a tool for social control, particularly when it comes to issues of data sovereignty and cybersecurity. As TechCrunch reports, some experts are now questioning whether OpenClaw's cybersecurity flaws make it unusable.


### [Blackstone backs Neysa in up to $1.2B financing as India pushes to build domestic AI infrastructure](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/blackstone-backs-neysa-in-up-to-1-2b-financing-as-india-pushes-to-build-domestic-ai-compute/)
*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a significant investment by Blackstone in Neysa, an Indian AI infrastructure startup, which will give Blackstone a majority stake. According to TechCrunch, this deal is noteworthy because it highlights India's push to build homegrown AI capabilities and its efforts to reduce reliance on foreign technology.

The story matters because it shows how private equity firms like Blackstone are backing startups that can help India scale up its domestic compute capacity for AI development. This investment also underscores the growing demand for specialized chips and data center capacity needed to train and run large AI models, creating a lucrative market for companies like Neysa.
