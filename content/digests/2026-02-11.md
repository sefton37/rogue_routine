### [Senior engineers, including co-founders, exit xAI amid controversy](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/senior-engineers-including-co-founders-exit-xai-amid-controversy/)
*TechCrunch*

**Daily Briefing:**

This article from TechCrunch reveals a significant power struggle at AI startup xAI, where multiple senior engineers and two co-founders have abruptly left the company amidst controversy surrounding its flagship product Grok. According to TechCrunch, nearly half of xAI's founding team has now departed, sparking concerns about governance and long-term stability.

The departures are noteworthy because they involve key figures in the development of xAI's technology, including Yuhai (Tony) Wu, an xAI co-founder and reasoning lead, who cited a desire for new opportunities and autonomy to build frontier tech more rapidly. This raises questions about the company's ability to retain top talent and maintain control over its products.

TechCrunch reports that some departing staff members are starting new ventures alongside other former xAI engineers, while others hint at seeking smaller teams with more autonomy to work on AI projects. The controversy surrounding Grok's behavior and child safety failures has intensified scrutiny around the company's stability as it prepares for an IPO.

### [Marc Benioff 'Jokes' ICE Is Watching Salesforce Employees Who Traveled to the U.S.](https://www.404media.co/marc-benioff-jokes-ice-is-watching-salesforce-employees-who-traveled-to-the-u-s/)
*404 Media*

According to 404 Media, a recent incident at Salesforce highlights the power dynamics between tech leaders and their employees. CEO Marc Benioff made a joke during an all-hands meeting in Las Vegas, stating that ICE agents were present to keep tabs on international employees who had traveled to the US for the event.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals the disconnect between tech leaders' words and actions. On one hand, Salesforce has been criticized for its contracts with ICE, which have sparked controversy within the company. On the other hand, Benioff's joke suggests that he may not fully understand or appreciate the harm caused by ICE's actions against immigrant communities.

The incident has sparked a wider discussion about accountability and empathy among tech leaders, highlighting the need for greater awareness and understanding of the impact of their actions on employees and communities.

*Tech Dirt*

This article reveals how politicians like Sen. Marsha Blackburn use public opinion manipulation to create fear and undermine institutions, in this case, the Supreme Court. According to Tech Dirt, Blackburn is trying to discredit Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson by claiming her attendance at an awards show where artists criticized ICE raises ethical questions about her impartiality.

The article highlights how Blackburn's behavior is performative and submissive, sucking up to a powerful figure (Trump) in order to gain favor. This dynamic reveals the power dynamics at play in politics, where those who curry favor with those in power often sacrifice their integrity and autonomy.

This quote from Tech Dirt's article perfectly captures the essence of Blackburn's behavior, highlighting how her actions are driven by a desire to gain favor rather than uphold principles or serve the public interest.

Tech Dirt reports that this story is noteworthy because it shows how politicians like Blackburn use misinformation and manipulation to undermine institutions and individuals. This reveals the importance of critical thinking and media literacy in today's information landscape, where those with power often seek to control the narrative and shape public opinion.
