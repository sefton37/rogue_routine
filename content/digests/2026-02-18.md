### [Preserving The Web Is Not The Problem. Losing It Is.](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/17/preserving-the-web-is-not-the-problem-losing-it-is/)
*Tech Dirt*

The article [Preserving The Web Is Not The Problem. Losing It Is.](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/17/preserving-the-web-is-not-the-problem-losing-it-is/) by Tech Dirt reveals a power struggle between news organizations and the Internet Archive, a non-profit dedicated to preserving the web. According to Tech Dirt, several major news outlets have blocked access to their content in the Wayback Machine, citing concerns that generative AI companies are using it for large-scale scraping.

However, the Internet Archive argues that this move risks erasing the historical record and creating a biased historical context. The article highlights the importance of preserving the web and working together to address legitimate concerns without compromising the archive. This story matters because it shows how powerful entities can control access to information and manipulate the narrative by blocking preservation efforts.

The article emphasizes the Internet Archive's mission to democratize access to knowledge and promote an open, referenceable, and enduring web. It also warns that when trusted publications are absent from archives, we risk creating a historical record biased against quality journalism. This is a critical issue because it affects not only researchers and journalists but also the public's ability to access and understand their own history.

The article quotes Mike Masnick as saying, "significant chunks of our journalistic record and historical cultural context simply… disappear." [Tech Dirt](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/17/preserving-the-web-is-not-the-problem-losing-it-is/) This quote underscores the unintended consequence of blocking preservation efforts: a loss of access to history.

The story reveals a tension between commercial interests and the public's right to knowledge. News organizations are prioritizing their own concerns over the importance of preserving the web, while the Internet Archive is fighting to maintain its mission. This power dynamic highlights the need for cooperation and collaboration in addressing legitimate concerns without compromising the archive.

### [San Jose Can Protect Immigrants by Ending Flock Surveillance System](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/op-ed-san-jose-can-protect-immigrants-ending-flock-surveillance-system)
*EFF*

This article, published by EFF, reveals a concerning trend of mass surveillance and potential misuse of automated license plate readers (ALPRs) by federal agencies. According to EFF, San Jose is being urged to terminate its contract with Flock Safety, an ALPR vendor, due to concerns about the system's ability to track innocent citizens' daily movements and activities.

The article highlights how ALPRs can be used to target immigrant communities and other vulnerable populations, raising fears about coercion and control. EFF reports that unauthorized agencies have accessed California ALPR data in the past, despite promises of secure access. This has led to a growing movement among local leaders to shut down or reconsider their ALPR programs.

This story matters because it reveals a power imbalance between local communities and federal agencies, with the latter using advanced surveillance technologies to exert control over marginalized groups. The article emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in the use of ALPRs, highlighting the risks of mass surveillance and its potential consequences for immigrant rights.

The article also downplays the benefits of ALPRs as a tool for public safety, instead focusing on their drawbacks and potential misuse by federal agencies. This narrative shift highlights the importance of critically evaluating the impact of emerging technologies on society and ensuring that they are used in ways that respect human rights and dignity.

Overall, this article is part of a broader pattern of concern about the use of surveillance technologies to control and manipulate certain groups, particularly immigrants and marginalized communities. It serves as a reminder of the need for ongoing scrutiny and advocacy to protect civil liberties and promote transparency in the use of advanced technologies.

### [Cowardly And Complicit CBS Pulls Colbert Interview With Dem Politician To Please Republicans](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/17/cowardly-and-complicit-cbs-pulls-colbert-interview-with-dem-politician-to-please-republicans/)
*Tech Dirt*

This article reveals a disturbing trend of media outlets prioritizing their audience share over free speech and journalistic integrity. According to Tech Dirt, CBS canceled an interview with Texas Democratic State Representative James Talarico on Stephen Colbert's "The Late Show" after being told by network lawyers that it would upset President Trump. This decision was likely driven by the network's fear of retribution from the FCC, led by Trump appointee Brendan Carr, who has been threatening to use the "equal time" rule to take action against talk shows that don't provide equal airtime to Republican ideology.

This story matters because it highlights the growing concern about the impact of right-wing extremism on media outlets and the need for them to stand up against censorship efforts. The article emphasizes how CBS's decision was motivated by a desire to avoid upsetting Trump, rather than a commitment to journalistic integrity or free speech. This is a clear example of corporate interests being prioritized over democratic values.

The article also reveals the coercive power dynamics at play in this situation. By threatening to use the "equal time" rule, Carr and the FCC are effectively silencing dissenting voices and limiting the ability of media outlets to hold those in power accountable. This is a classic example of how fear-based systems can be used to control behavior and stifle free expression.

Furthermore, this story highlights the tension between corporate interests and democratic values. The article notes that CBS's decision was likely driven by a desire to maintain its audience share and avoid retribution from Trump, rather than a commitment to journalistic integrity or free speech. This is a clear example of how systemic design can be used to prioritize profit over people.

> "Let’s just call this what it is: Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV, OK? He’s like a toddler with too much screen time. He gets cranky and then drops a load in his diaper." — Stephen Colbert

### [EFF to Wisconsin Legislature: VPN Bans Are Still a Terrible Idea](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/eff-wisconsin-legislature-vpn-bans-are-still-terrible-idea)
*EFF*

According to EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a bill in Wisconsin's legislature aims to ban Virtual Private Network (VPN) access to certain websites and censor lawful speech. This bill has already passed the State Assembly and is scheduled for a vote in the State Senate tomorrow.

The EFF argues that this bill would be "technically unworkable" and create a privacy nightmare by requiring websites to collect sensitive personal data from users. The bill's age-verification requirements and VPN ban would undermine cybersecurity, chill lawful speech, and expose websites to vague and unpredictable enforcement.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals the ongoing struggle for control over online access and information in the United States. EFF reports that lawmakers are pushing for measures that would restrict internet freedom, despite concerns about their technical feasibility and impact on users' rights. The bill's passage through the State Assembly highlights the power dynamics at play, where lawmakers can override expert warnings and push forward with legislation that may have far-reaching consequences.

> "It’s an age-verification bill that effectively bans VPN access to certain websites for Wisconsinites and censors lawful speech." — [EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/eff-wisconsin-legislature-vpn-bans-are-still-terrible-idea)

### [Ford turns to F1 and bounties to build a $30,000 electric truck](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/ford-turns-to-f1-and-bounties-to-build-a-30000-electric-truck/)
*TechCrunch*

This article from TechCrunch reveals how Ford is using innovative strategies to stay competitive in the electric vehicle market. By adopting Formula 1 thinking and implementing a bounty program, Ford aims to create an affordable EV truck starting at $30,000. This move comes after the company took a significant financial hit due to the discontinuation of its battery-electric F-150 Lightning.

According to TechCrunch, Ford's approach involves using a universal EV platform (UEV) and 3D-printed components to achieve efficiency in design and production. The UEV is expected to be more aerodynamically efficient than other pickup trucks on the market, with features such as power-folding mirrors that decrease drag.

TechCrunch reports: "Ford's bet on a line of affordable EVs began several years ago with a skunkworks team led by Alan Clarke, a 12-year Tesla veteran." This highlights Ford's willingness to experiment and adapt in order to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle market.

### [Meta’s own research found parental supervision doesn’t really help curb teens’ compulsive social media use](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/metas-own-research-found-parental-supervision-doesnt-really-help-curb-teens-compulsive-social-media-use/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, Meta's internal study, Project MYST, reveals that even when parents try to limit their children's screen time or restrict access to certain platforms, it does not necessarily reduce teenagers' likelihood of overusing social media. This finding is significant because it suggests that the design of social media products themselves may be more influential in shaping teens' behavior than parental controls.

The study also found that stressful life events can contribute to teenagers' struggles with moderating their social media use. TechCrunch reports that this research is being used as evidence in a landmark trial against Meta and other social media companies, which alleges that they intentionally design their products to be addictive and harm young users. This trial has the potential to impact how these companies approach their younger users and could prompt regulators to take further action.

This story matters because it highlights the complex relationship between technology, power, and control in shaping our behavior. By acknowledging the limitations of parental controls, Meta's research implies that social media companies have a significant responsibility to design products that promote healthy use habits among teenagers. The trial against Meta and other social media companies is a critical moment in this conversation, as it seeks to hold these companies accountable for their role in shaping the online experiences of young users.

### [Password managers' promise that they can't see your vaults isn't always true](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/password-managers-promise-that-they-cant-see-your-vaults-isnt-always-true/)
*Ars Technica*

According to Ars Technica, a recent investigation has found that some popular password managers are not living up to their claims of "zero knowledge" encryption. This means that even if these companies say they can't access users' sensitive data, vulnerabilities in their account recovery processes and sharing features can still allow malicious insiders or hackers to gain access.

This story is noteworthy because it reveals a fundamental flaw in the security promises made by password managers. These services are supposed to be our last line of defense against cyber threats, but if they're not secure themselves, what's the point? It's a stark reminder that even with the best intentions and most advanced technology, there's always room for human error or exploitation.


### [Hey Brett Kavanaugh, This Is On You:](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/17/hey-brett-kavanaugh-this-is-on-you/)
*Tech Dirt*

This article is noteworthy because it reveals a stark disconnect between the words of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the harsh realities faced by US citizens during immigration stops. According to Tech Dirt, at least 170 incidents have been reported where US citizens were detained, beaten, and held for days by immigration agents, despite Kavanaugh's statement that officers would "promptly let the individual go" if they learned the person was a US citizen or lawfully in the country.

The article highlights the abuse of power by immigration agents and the need for a new ruling that clarifies the rights of US citizens during these stops. It also shows how a single statement can have far-reaching consequences, sparking outrage and calls for accountability from the public. As Tech Dirt reports, Kavanaugh has some explaining to do about his inaccurate statement and its impact on real people's lives.


### [SC State Senator Proposes Bill To Remove Religious Exemptions For Vaccines In Public School Children](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/17/sc-state-senator-proposes-bill-to-remove-religious-exemptions-for-vaccines-in-public-school-children/)
*Tech Dirt*

According to Tech Dirt, a South Carolina state senator has introduced a bill to remove religious exemptions for measles vaccinations in public K-12 schools and childcare settings. This move aims to increase vaccination rates and limit the spread of measles, which has been on the rise in the state.

The article reveals a growing tension between public health concerns and individual rights, specifically around vaccination exemptions. Tech Dirt reports that some have expressed support for the bill, while others are pushing back against it, arguing that it infringes upon religious freedom. This highlights the complexities of balancing collective well-being with personal liberties.

> "In the absence of federal leadership, the states will attempt to take action on their own. And sometimes those actions will result in federal pushback from the very same people who are causing the problem through inaction in the first place." — Tech Dirt
— [Tech Dirt](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/17/sc-state-senator-proposes-bill-to-remove-religious-exemptions-for-vaccines-in-public-school-children/)


This story is noteworthy because it showcases how state governments are taking matters into their own hands when faced with inadequate federal response to public health crises. It also underscores the ongoing debate about individual rights versus collective well-being, particularly in the context of vaccination policies.

### [Intellexa’s Predator spyware used to hack iPhone of journalist in Angola, research says](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/intellexas-predator-spyware-used-to-hack-iphone-of-journalist-in-angola-research-says/)
*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a disturbing trend where governments are using commercial surveillance vendors like Intellexa to target journalists and ordinary citizens with powerful phone-hacking software. According to TechCrunch, Amnesty International's report shows that a government customer of Intellexa hacked into the iPhone of prominent journalist Teixeira Cândido in Angola, sending him malicious links via WhatsApp.

This story is noteworthy because it highlights the ongoing use of commercial surveillance vendors by governments to silence critics and undermine press freedom. The fact that Intellexa's Predator spyware was used to target a journalist in Angola is particularly concerning, as it suggests that these vendors are being used to suppress dissenting voices in various parts of the world.

This incident is just one example of how commercial surveillance vendors are being used to erode human rights and undermine democratic institutions. It's essential for policymakers and tech companies to take action against these vendors and ensure that their products are not being used to harm innocent people.

### [Most VMware users still "actively reducing their VMware footprint," survey finds](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/most-vmware-users-still-actively-reducing-their-vmware-footprint-survey-finds/)
*Ars Technica*

According to Ars Technica, a recent survey of IT decision-makers reveals that most VMware users are still struggling with the aftermath of Broadcom's acquisition in 2023. The survey found that nearly nine out of ten respondents described the change as "disruptive," citing price increases, uncertainty about Broadcom's plans, and support quality concerns as major drivers of disruption.

This story is noteworthy because it highlights how large corporations can wield significant power over their customers through acquisitions and pricing strategies. It reveals a clear example of vendor lock-in, where companies are forced to adapt to new terms and conditions imposed by the acquiring company, rather than being able to freely choose alternative solutions. As one respondent noted, "the squeeze is just beginning," indicating that the challenges faced by VMware users may only be the tip of the iceberg.

The survey also underscores the tension between technological innovation and economic control. While Broadcom's acquisition of VMware has brought about significant changes in the virtualization market, it has also created uncertainty and disruption for customers who are now forced to navigate a new pricing structure and support model. This story highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in corporate acquisitions, particularly when they involve critical infrastructure and services that affect entire industries.

### [Climactic launches hybrid fund to get startups through the ‘valley of death’](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/climactic-launches-hybrid-fund-to-get-startups-through-the-valley-of-death/)
*TechCrunch*

This article is noteworthy because it reveals a new approach to funding startups, particularly those in the materials and climate tech sectors. According to TechCrunch, Climactic has launched a hybrid fund called Material Scale that provides a guaranteed customer for materials startups, helping them overcome the "valley of death" - a common challenge where startups struggle to scale up production.

The article highlights how this fund uses a debt-equity investment vehicle to give startups a boost with minimal dilution. This innovative approach shows how investors are trying to adapt to the needs of physical goods companies, which often face different challenges than software startups. The involvement of Ralph Lauren and Investor Structure Climate as partners suggests that established players are recognizing the potential of these startups.

This quote from Josh Felser underscores the problem faced by materials companies in scaling up production without a guaranteed customer. The article's focus on climate tech and materials startups highlights the growing importance of these sectors in addressing global challenges.
