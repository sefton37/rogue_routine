Judge Fred Biery's ruling granted habeas corpus to a five-year-old child and his father, while Judge Ana Reyes' 83-page ruling in the Haitian TPS case is even more critical, laying bare the government's disregard for immigration laws and constitutional protections.

The article highlights the power dynamics at play, where the executive branch is pushing the limits of its authority, and the judiciary is pushing back. This marks a significant departure from traditional judicial deference to the executive branch, with judges now emphasizing their commitment to upholding the Constitution. The language used by the judges, including Biery's civics lesson and Reyes' 83-page dismantling of the cabinet secretary's decision, underscores the gravity of the situation.

The article also reveals a broader pattern of systemic problems, where the government is prioritizing deportation quotas over constitutional protections and human rights. This raises concerns about the erosion of due process and the rule of law in the United States. The judges' willingness to speak truth to power and call out the administration's actions as "bullshit" suggests that they are committed to upholding the Constitution, even if it means challenging the executive branch.

> "The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children." — Judge Fred Biery
— [Tech Dirt](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/04/federal-judges-are-done-with-the-deference-courts-call-out-admins-immigration-bullshit-in-increasingly-pointed-terms/)

*Tech Dirt*

This article, reported by Tech Dirt, reveals a stark contrast between the Trump administration's rhetoric and reality when it comes to immigration policy and public health. According to Tech Dirt, measles outbreaks have begun to spread in immigrant detention camps, highlighting the poor conditions and lack of medical care within these facilities.

The irony is palpable: despite claims that immigrants bring disease into the country, it appears that the detention centers themselves are becoming breeding grounds for illness. As one official noted, "ICE Health Services Corps immediately took steps to quarantine and control further spread and infection, ceasing all movement within the facility and quarantining all individuals suspected of making contact with the infected." This quote underscores the gravity of the situation and the administration's response.

### [Microsoft releases urgent Office patch. Russian-state hackers pounce.](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/russian-state-hackers-exploit-office-vulnerability-to-infect-computers/)
*Ars Technica*

This article reveals a concerning trend of state-aligned actors rapidly exploiting newly discovered vulnerabilities to compromise critical systems. According to Ars Technica, Russian-state hackers, tracked under names including APT28, wasted no time exploiting a critical Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) just 48 hours after the company released an urgent security update.

This incident highlights the speed and precision of state-aligned actors in weaponizing new vulnerabilities, shrinking the window for defenders to patch critical systems. As Ars Technica reports, "The use of CVE-2026-21509 demonstrates how quickly state-aligned actors can weaponize new vulnerabilities." This suggests that even with rapid response times from software vendors, sophisticated attackers can still gain a foothold in targeted organizations.

The article also underscores the sophistication and stealth of these attacks. The hackers used advanced exploits and payloads that were encrypted and ran in memory to evade detection by endpoint protection systems. This level of technical expertise and coordination raises questions about the nature of state-sponsored cyber threats and their potential impact on global security.

*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, Tinder is introducing an AI-powered feature called Chemistry to combat "swipe fatigue," a growing problem among online dating users who feel burned out from swiping through too many profiles. This move reveals the company's attempt to address user pain points and improve engagement by leveraging artificial intelligence.

The article highlights how Tinder's decline in new registrations and monthly active users has led the company to turn towards AI-driven recommendations as a partial solution. By redesigning discovery and using facial recognition verification, Tinder aims to cut down on bad actors and provide a more personalized experience for its users.

This story is noteworthy because it showcases how technology companies are increasingly relying on AI to solve user engagement issues, rather than addressing the root causes of these problems.

### [Meta tests a standalone app for its AI-generated ‘Vibes’ videos](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/meta-tests-a-standalone-app-for-its-ai-generated-vibes-videos/)
*TechCrunch*

Here's my analysis of the article:

This story is noteworthy because it reveals Meta's aggressive move to expand its AI-generated content platform, Vibes, into a standalone app that directly competes with OpenAI's Sora. According to TechCrunch, Meta has seen strong early traction within its own AI app and wants to capitalize on this momentum by offering a dedicated home for users to create, discover, and share AI-generated videos.

The article highlights how Meta is positioning Vibes as a more immersive experience, separate from the Meta AI app, which suggests that the company is trying to corner the market on AI-generated content. This move also raises questions about power consolidation in the tech industry, where a few large players like Meta and OpenAI are vying for dominance.

The article doesn't delve deeper into these themes, but it's clear that this development has significant implications for how we interact with technology and what kind of content we consume. As TechCrunch reports, Meta plans to expand the app further based on community feedback, which could lead to a more tailored experience for users. However, it also raises concerns about data collection and user control in these AI-powered platforms.

### [Sam Altman got exceptionally testy over Claude Super Bowl ads](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/sam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, a heated exchange has erupted between OpenAI and Anthropic, two major players in the AI-powered chatbot market. The controversy centers around Anthropic's Super Bowl ads, which mock OpenAI's plan to introduce targeted ads in its ChatGPT chatbot.

The ads, which depict ChatGPT inserting ads into conversations, have sparked a strong reaction from Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI. He accused Anthropic of being "dishonest" and "authoritarian," defending his company's approach to advertising in ChatGPT.

This story is noteworthy because it highlights the competitive dynamics between OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as the ongoing debate about the role of ads in AI-powered chatbots. The exchange reveals a power struggle between these two companies, with each trying to assert its dominance in the market.

### [Mundi Ventures closes on €750M for Kembara, its largest deep tech and climate fund](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/mundi-ventures-closes-on-e750m-for-kembara-its-largest-deep-tech-and-climate-fund/)
*TechCrunch*

This article reveals a significant power consolidation play by Mundi Ventures, a Spanish venture capital firm, with the launch of its largest fund yet, Kembara. According to TechCrunch, Kembara has secured a €750 million first close, with plans to invest between €15-40 million in 20 companies, and potentially up to €100 million per company for follow-on investments.

What's noteworthy is that this fund is specifically designed to address the "Series B funding gap" in European climate tech startups, which often fail at this stage due to lack of capital. By securing a large sum of money from the European Investment Fund, Mundi Ventures is positioning itself as a major player in the deep tech and climate space.

As TechCrunch reports, Kembara's co-founder Yann de Vries emphasizes the need for non-dilutive financing options for deep tech founders, citing his experience with Lilium's bankruptcy as a lesson learned. This highlights the tension between venture capital firms seeking high returns on investment and startups struggling to survive without sacrificing equity.

The article also reveals that Kembara is not just another fund, but rather a productized non-dilutive financing solution designed to attract limited partners who are willing to coinvest in winners. This suggests a shift towards more structured and scalable approaches to venture capital investing, which could have significant implications for the industry as a whole.
