The fact that both Democrats and Republicans are expressing concerns about data centers highlights the complexity of this issue. As Senator Bernie Sanders noted, "data centers will lead to higher energy bills just so some chatbot can corrupt some 13 year old kid online." This quote reveals a deeper critique of the tech industry's priorities and the consequences of its rapid growth.

The Indian government is making a significant move to support deep tech startups, which typically take longer to mature than conventional ventures. According to TechCrunch, the government has updated its startup framework to double the period for which deep tech companies are treated as startups to 20 years and raise the revenue threshold for tax benefits and regulatory advantages.

This move reveals that the Indian government is prioritizing support for deep tech startups, recognizing their potential to drive innovation and economic growth.

The article highlights the importance of regulatory reform in creating an ecosystem conducive to long-horizon investing in deep tech. By combining policy changes with public capital mobilization, the Indian government is taking a proactive approach to address funding gaps and support the development of science-led companies. This effort may inspire other governments to reevaluate their policies and provide similar support for emerging technologies.

The article also mentions the India Deep Tech Alliance, a $1 billion-plus private investor coalition launched by US and Indian venture firms. This alliance aims to fund deep tech startups in India, further underscoring the growing interest in supporting these companies.
