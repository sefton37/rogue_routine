### [New York lawmakers propose a three-year pause on new data centers](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/07/new-york-lawmakers-propose-a-three-year-pause-on-new-data-centers/)
*TechCrunch*

This article reveals growing concerns about the rapid expansion of data centers driven by AI infrastructure investments, and how it's affecting local communities and the environment. According to TechCrunch, New York state lawmakers have proposed a three-year moratorium on new data center construction, citing increased energy bills and potential environmental harm.

The proposal reflects a shift in public opinion, with even some Republicans expressing concerns about the impact of data centers on surrounding areas. As one critic noted, "higher energy bills just so some chatbot can corrupt some 13 year old kid online." This highlights the tension between technological progress and social responsibility, particularly when it comes to issues like energy consumption and environmental sustainability.

The article also underscores the growing influence of environmental groups in shaping policy decisions. More than 230 organizations have signed an open letter to Congress calling for a national moratorium on data center construction. This development suggests that public pressure is mounting against unchecked technological growth, and that policymakers are starting to take notice.

### [India has changed its startup rules for deep tech](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/07/india-has-changed-its-startup-rules-for-deep-tech/)
*TechCrunch*

According to TechCrunch, India's government has made significant changes to its startup framework to support deep tech companies. This move is noteworthy because it reveals a deliberate effort by the Indian government to create a long-horizon ecosystem for science- and engineering-led businesses.

The article highlights how the government is addressing funding gaps in early-stage deep tech companies through a ₹1 trillion Research, Development and Innovation Fund (RDI). By mobilizing public capital and adjusting policy timelines, India's government is attempting to align its support with the unique development cycles of deep tech startups. This shift suggests that the Indian government recognizes the value of investing in long-term innovation, rather than prioritizing short-term gains.

The article also reveals a collaborative approach between the government and private investors, as seen in the launch of the India Deep Tech Alliance. This coalition aims to provide patient financing for science-led and R&D-driven companies, further indicating a commitment to supporting deep tech startups.

According to Tech Dirt, this article reveals how quickly tech policies and trends can evolve. It highlights the attacks on Section 230, a law that protects online platforms from liability for user-generated content, which were coming fast in 2021. The article shows how politicians and experts were spreading misinformation about the law, and how it was being used as a scapegoat for other issues.

The article also touches on the power dynamics at play, where those in positions of authority are trying to exert control over online speech and content moderation. It's noteworthy that Tech Dirt is highlighting these events from 2021, as it shows how the conversation around Section 230 has been ongoing for years, with no clear resolution.

This quote reveals the lack of understanding and expertise among some politicians when it comes to online governance. It's a stark reminder that those in power often don't grasp the complexities of the issues they're trying to regulate.
