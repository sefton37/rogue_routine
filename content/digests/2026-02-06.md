## Deep Dives

### [Yes to the “ICE Out of Our Faces Act”](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/yes-ice-out-my-face-act)
*EFF*

This article reveals a disturbing power dynamic between government agencies and citizens, particularly those from marginalized communities. According to EFF, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have been using face recognition technology to scan faces of people suspected of being in the country unlawfully - over 100,000 times, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. This has led to misidentifications, violence, and intrusions on digital rights and civil liberties.

The "ICE Out of Our Faces Act" aims to combat these abuses by banning ICE and CBP agents from acquiring or using biometric surveillance systems, including face recognition technology. EFF reports that this bill would be enforceable through a strong private right of action, allowing individuals to sue if their rights are violated. As EFF explains, "Face recognition technology is so dangerous that government should not use it at all—least of all these out-of-control immigration agencies."

This story matters because it highlights the coercive power of facial recognition technology in the hands of government agencies. By emphasizing the risks of misidentification and violence, EFF is drawing attention to the need for greater accountability and transparency in the use of biometric surveillance systems. The article also underscores the importance of protecting digital rights and civil liberties, particularly for marginalized communities who are disproportionately affected by these technologies.

The fact that ICE has been using face recognition technology over 100,000 times raises serious concerns about systemic design and incentive architecture. It suggests that the agency is prioritizing efficiency and control over individual rights and safety. The "ICE Out of Our Faces Act" represents a crucial step towards addressing these issues and promoting a more just and equitable society.

*Tech Dirt*

According to Tech Dirt, a 67-year-old retired Philadelphia man was subjected to an administrative subpoena from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after sending a polite email to a government lawyer asking for mercy in a deportation case. This development reveals a concerning trend where the government is using its surveillance powers to intimidate and silence dissenting voices.

The article highlights that prominent "free speech" advocates, such as Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, and Michael Shellenberger, who previously sounded alarms about alleged censorship under the Biden administration, are now eerily quiet on this issue. This silence suggests a double standard where they only speak out against perceived censorship when it suits their agenda.

The story matters because it reveals a consolidation of power and erosion of trust in institutions. The use of administrative subpoenas without a judge's oversight demonstrates a disregard for due process and the rule of law. Furthermore, the intimidation tactics employed by DHS raise concerns about the government's willingness to silence dissenting voices and stifle free speech.

The article also highlights the hypocrisy of some "free speech" advocates who are now quiet on this issue. Their previous claims of censorship under the Biden administration were largely unfounded, and their silence on this real-life example of government overreach is telling. This development underscores the importance of holding those in power accountable for their actions and ensuring that free speech is protected.

The article emphasizes the need for a critical examination of the government's use of surveillance powers and its impact on individual rights. It also highlights the importance of media scrutiny and accountability in exposing instances of government overreach and intimidation.

The author argues that Microsoft's obsession with AI has led to a culture in decline, prioritizing growth over user experience and leading to massive layoffs.

The article also sheds light on the dark side of business software and digital infrastructure, where Microsoft's products are often forced upon users without their consent. This is a clear example of how technology can be used to exert control over individuals and organizations, rather than serving their needs.

As Where's Your Ed At reports, Microsoft's aggressive sales tactics and monopolistic behavior have created a toxic culture within the company, with many employees speaking out against its practices. The article emphasizes that this is not just a problem for Microsoft, but a broader issue of corporate power and control in the tech industry.

The author notes that "Microsoft exists as a kind of dark presence over business software and digital infrastructure," highlighting the company's ability to seep into organizations and force them to use its products. This is a powerful metaphor for the ways in which large corporations can exert control over individuals and communities, often without their knowledge or consent.

Overall, this article matters because it reveals the darker side of corporate power and control in the tech industry.

This story is noteworthy because it highlights the power struggle between two major AI players. The fact that OpenAI is pushing back against Anthropic's criticism suggests a deeper concern about losing control over the attention economy and their revenue streams. As Ars Technica reports, "Real betrayal isn't ads. It's control."
