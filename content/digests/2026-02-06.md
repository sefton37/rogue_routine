## Deep Dives

### [Yes to the “ICE Out of Our Faces Act”](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/yes-ice-out-my-face-act)
*EFF*

This article reveals a disturbing power dynamic where government agencies, specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), are using facial recognition technology to surveil and misidentify individuals, often with violent consequences. According to EFF, these agencies have descended into "utter lawlessness," scanning faces of people suspected of being in the country illegally over 100,000 times.

The article highlights the dangers of biometric surveillance systems, which can perpetuate violence and intrusions on digital rights and civil liberties. EFF reports that government agencies should not use face recognition technology at all, especially when it comes to immigration enforcement. The "ICE Out of Our Faces Act" aims to ban ICE and CBP agents from acquiring or using such systems, but the bill's passage is uncertain.

This story matters because it exposes the misuse of facial recognition technology by government agencies, which can have devastating consequences for marginalized communities. EFF's advocacy for this legislation underscores the need for stricter regulations on biometric surveillance systems and the importance of protecting digital rights and civil liberties. The article also reveals a broader pattern of systemic problems, including the exploitation of vulnerable populations and the erosion of trust in institutions.

As EFF states, "Face recognition technology is so dangerous that government should not use it at all—least of all these out-of-control immigration agencies." This quote emphasizes the urgency of addressing this issue and highlights the need for more robust safeguards to prevent the misuse of biometric surveillance systems.

### [DHS Is Hunting Down Trump Critics. The ‘Free Speech’ Warriors Are Mighty Quiet.](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/05/dhs-is-hunting-down-trump-critics-the-free-speech-warriors-are-mighty-quiet/)
*Tech Dirt*

This article reveals a disturbing trend of government overreach and intimidation, specifically targeting individuals who criticize government policy. According to Tech Dirt, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been using administrative subpoenas to demand personal information from citizens who speak out against government actions.

The story highlights the case of a 67-year-old retired Philadelphia man who was subjected to such treatment after sending a polite email to a government lawyer asking for mercy in a deportation case. This development raises concerns about the misuse of surveillance powers by the government to silence dissenting voices.

What's striking is that prominent "free speech" advocates, who previously sounded alarms about alleged censorship under the Biden administration, are now eerily quiet on this issue. Tech Dirt notes that if similar stories had happened under the Biden administration, these same individuals would be screaming about the crushing boot of the government trying to silence speech.

This story matters because it reveals a power dynamic where the government is using its surveillance apparatus to intimidate and silence citizens who exercise their right to free speech. It also highlights the hypocrisy of some "free speech" advocates who are more concerned with protecting conservative speech than actual freedom of expression.

The article emphasizes the importance of holding those in power accountable for their actions, particularly when it comes to issues like surveillance and censorship. By downplaying or ignoring this story, these "free speech" warriors are complicit in allowing the government to erode trust in institutions and silence dissenting voices.

This is a broader pattern of systemic problems, where governments use fear-mongering and intimidation tactics to control public discourse and maintain their power. It's essential for citizens to remain vigilant and speak out against such abuses of authority.

### [Premium: The Hater's Guide To Microsoft](https://www.wheresyoured.at/premium-the-haters-guide-to-microsoft/)
*Where's Your Ed At*

According to Where's Your Ed At, this article reveals a disturbing pattern of corporate dominance and manipulation in the tech industry. The author speaks to over 100 tech workers who share negative experiences with Microsoft, citing aggressive sales tactics, mediocre products, and a focus on scale rather than innovation. This is not just a critique of Microsoft's business practices, but also a warning about the dangers of unchecked corporate power.

The article highlights how Microsoft uses its dominance in the software market to force users onto its products, often at the expense of user experience. This is a classic example of monopolistic behavior, where a company uses its size and influence to stifle competition and maintain its grip on the market. The author notes that this has been going on for decades, with Microsoft throwing its weight around in the 80s to crowd out potential competitors.

What's striking about this article is how it reveals the human cost of corporate dominance. The tech workers interviewed by the author share stories of being forced to use subpar products, being subjected to aggressive sales tactics, and being laid off due to Microsoft's focus on growth over user experience.

The article also highlights the role of AI in perpetuating this cycle of dominance. Microsoft's obsession with AI has led to a culture in decline, where innovation and user experience are sacrificed for the sake of growth and profit. This is a warning sign that we should all be paying attention to, as it suggests that the tech industry is prioritizing profits over people.

The author's tone is critical, but also nuanced and thoughtful. They acknowledge the complexity of the issue and the ways in which Microsoft has contributed to the tech industry's growth and innovation.

This contrast highlights a fundamental question about who should control access to information and how users should be treated: should they be bombarded with ads or offered a more premium experience?

Anthropic's campaign seems to have touched a nerve at OpenAI, which has just begun testing ads in its chatbot, ChatGPT. The fact that OpenAI is now pushing back against Anthropic's approach suggests that the company may be trying to defend its own business model and maintain control over user interactions.

## Patterns & Signals
* Three stories — "Yes to the 'ICE Out of Our Faces Act'" [1], "DHS Is Hunting Down Trump Critics. The 'Free Speech' Warriors Are Mighty Quiet." [5], and [Facial Recognition Tech Used To Hunt Migrants Was Deployed Without Required Privacy Paperwork](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/06/facial-recognition-tech-used-to-hunt-migrants-was-deployed-without-required-privacy-paperwork/) [6] — show federal agencies testing compliance boundaries, from subpoenas to warrantless arrests to app takedowns.
* A combination of articles reveals how tech companies are exerting control over their platforms and APIs, often prioritizing growth and profit over user experience [2][3]. This trend is mirrored in the attention economy, where AI-powered tools are being used to manipulate users and create dependencies.
* The release of new agentic coding models by OpenAI and Anthropic highlights a shift towards treating AI as a delegated workforce rather than a conversation partner [7].
